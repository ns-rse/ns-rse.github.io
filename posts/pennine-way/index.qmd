This summer I decided to hike the iconic [Pennine Way][pw] a 431 kilometre (261 miles) national trail stretching between
[Kirk Yetholm][ky] in the North and [Edale][edale] in the South. Traditionally the route is hiked from South to North
but as I live in Sheffield and have hiked around Kinder, Bleaklow and Blackhill I decided to hike from North to South as
even if I didn't complete the route I would get to see places I wasn't familiar with and it was also cheaper to buy an
advance rail ticket than have to purchase one on the day of return as I had no idea how long it would take.

![[Not Pennine Way](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53930940490/) by

## Planning

A number of years ago I attempted to hike the Pennine Way from Edale and having set off from Edale and reached Crowden
in good time decided I could combine the first two days and continued to Standedge. This was a mistake as I wasn't used
to hiking with such weight and its a rough section up over Laddow Rocks. Half way there my knee didn't like this and I
hobbled the rest of the way and called my wife to come and collect me, heading home with my tail between my legs.

I didn't want to repeat this but I had no idea how long this would take me so booked two and a half weeks off of work
allowing me 18 days to complete. I use [OpenStreetMap][osm] and the excellent [BRouter WebUI][brouter] to plan days of
upto 35km hiking although one day came in at 44km which I was wary of as I typically don't enjoy hiking more than 30km
without carrying significant weight so didn't want to push myself too hard. But I figured I could be flexible and go
slower if needed, and it wouldn't be a problem if I was faster I could just drink more beer!

A kit list of what I took is at the end along with details of what I used and didn't, but I took everything I needed for
camping along with clothes, a stove for boiling water, six dehydrated meals, maps, battery pack and a guide which I
would have to read backwards as it covered the route from South to North over 20 days.

## Tracking

I use [OpenTracks][openttracks] to privately record [GPX][gpx] tracks of my hiking, running and cycling as it stores
them only on the device on which they are recorded, although you can of course copy them elsewhere and use them as you
like. I did this each day I hiked recording almost complete traces for the whole trip. I had one short drop out and
missed restarting after having a meal but after that often left it running whilst stopped for lunch or dinner sto avoid
forgetting to restart.

I uploaded each track to an instance of [FitTrackee][ft] that I host myself which provided a neat way of reviewing the
statistics for each days hiking which I have exported and saved to CSV and used in the tables and figures of this
write-up.

Details and more information about these and other Open Source tools for self-research that protect the users privacy
from the pernicious intrusions made by Big Tech can be found on the [Personal Science Wiki][psw].

## Pictures

I carried my phone, a Motorla GT100 and a Sony RX100 Mk IV with me along the route. I take a _lot_ of pictures, most are
crap but some are half decent and I've included in this post the better ones or those that accompany the story well. You
can find the full set of pictures on my [Pennine Way Flickr album][flickr_pw].

## Day by Day

### Day 1 - Sheffield to Kirk Yetholm

Having packed over the previous few days I weighed the rucksack with 2 litres of water attached, 17.4kg.

This was a walking holiday so I waved goodbye to my wife and daughter around 07:30 feeling fresh and walked to the train
station to catch the 08:22 train to Berwick-Upon-Tweed. Being Sheffield this involved a hill and it wasn't too bad
carrying the extra weight of the rucksack.

The train journey was uneventful, but gave me time to sit and read a book on the Kobo I bought with me. I had bought the
Kobo for hiking in the Julian Alps of Slovenia the previous year as I didn't want to carry multiple books. Having
recently started reading Johann Harri's [_Stolen Focus : Why You Can't Pay Attention_][stolenfocus] I expected to get through it
and had some fiction to read as well (Haruki Murakami's [_IQ84_][iq84]). The countryside passed by as did the first couple
of chapters and before long I was getting off at Berwick-Upon-Tweed.

I'd checked the schedule and had a short wait before the bus to Kelso arrived. There was a gentleman trying to
straighten one of two buckled wheels on his bike outside the station. Its quite hard to buckle wheels and I figured he'd
therefore been in an accident recently so went and asked if he was ok. He said he was but that he'd been knocked off by
a car turning across him. He was lucky and only had a few bruises but his bike was not ride-able and he was supposed to
be cycling to Wales. He asked me to stand on one side of the wheel whilst he stood on the other to try and straighten
it. Unsurprisingly this didn't work. He then noticed some fence railings and tried levering it
straight...unsuccessfully. Not only were both his wheels buckled but the built-in pannier rack that was part of the
frame had sheered off so he would have trouble carrying his bags. He wasn't hurt so I left him to his own devices and
explored Castle Vale Park which led down to the River Tweed by the Royal Border Bridge and the remains of Berwick
Castle.

![[Royal Border Bridge, Berwick Upon Tweed | Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957436114/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957436114_f54e2d4177_k.jpg)

A nice way to kill some time but I didn't want to miss my bus so headed back through Castle Vale Park to wait at
the bus stop. It arrived and set-off on time and I bounced through some nice farmland towards Kelso, spying The Cheviot
hills in the distance which I would be hiking up in a few hours.

Didn't have masses of time to explore Kelso but grabbed a baguette and had a pint around the town square and purchased a
bottle of [Traquair Jacobite Ale (8% ABV)](https://www.traquair.co.uk/product/traquair-jacobite-ale/) to drink before
bed (with limited weight I wanted something strong!).

Another bus journey and I arrived in Kirk Yetholm. I'd clocked someone who looked like they were hiking and as we got of
asked where he was heading. He said he was supposed to have been doing an Ultrar-marathon through the area but had
injured himself a few days before the start so was taking active recovery by walking and bussing his way along the
route. He kindly offered to snap a picture of me next to the Pennine Way map on the bus-stop, bid me farewell and headed
off whilst I went for another pint in [The Border][border], the pub that marks the "end" (or start) of the Pennine Way.

![[The Border Inn |
Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957365903/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957365903_dbc8889de8_k.jpg)

Had a nice chat with a local who had lived in Sheffield in the past and was joined by what seemed the proprietor of the
pub who said me I should sign the log-book behind the bar even though I was leaving. I duly did so to log the start date
somewhere and considered purchasing a t-shirt but a) it was in the wrong direction and b) I hadn't even started, let
alone finished hiking at that point. One of them kindly offered to snap a picture of me in front of the pub's display of
the end of The Way.

### Day 1 - 2024-08-14 Kirk Yetholm to Clennell Street


Beer drunk I said farewell, shouldered my pack and started the GPS tracker, setting off up the lane in the heat of the
afternoon. Not ideal conditions for hiking but I had a schedule to follow.

![[Above Kirk Yetholm | Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957116986/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957116986_2f287b5fb9_k.jpg)

![[Follow The Path | Pretty good advice for route finding most of the way |
Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957365433/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957365433_2875252fee_k.jpg)

There are two options to this section of The
Way, a high option going over various hills and low option for when weather is foul. I didn't have that excuse and had
been planning on stopping for the night at the [Auchope Refuge Hut][auchope] which was on the high route so up the hills
I went. These undulated but the path was good and I made good time arriving at the hut in around three hours.

![[Auchope Refuge |
Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957365283/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957365283_8955e170d8_k.jpg)

With a few more hours of daylight left I decided to push on and find somewhere else to wild camp as my legs weren't
tired and I had plenty of time, even though this involved a steep climb from Auchope Rigg up most of Cairn Hill. I
decided in doing so not to do the dog-leg extension of The Way across the flat-ish moor to the summit of The Cheviot,
the hill after which the area is named as it added an extra 4km to the journey and would have taken about an hour and I
was now on the lookout for somewhere to stop.

Heading downhill there weren't many options forthcoming, lots of heather with a path through it but as things levelled
out I came to a cross-roads with a path marked Clennell Street with a sign indicating that motor vehicles were not
allowed between 1st April and 1st May. Quite how anything but motorbikes could get up there I've no idea, but there was
a flat patch of grass so I donned a long-sleeve top to keep the midges away and setup the tent and bed for the
night. That done I had my dinner of some ciabatta and pate along with the bottle of Traquair Jacobite I'd carried along
and as the sunset I snuggled down for the first night under canvas feeling pleased to have gone a little further than
planned and had no problems hiking up the hills with the weight of my pack.

![[Clennell Street |
Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53923626465/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53923626465_6a76fe5f8a_k.jpg)

### Day 2 - Clennell Street to Bryness

Woke early around 05:00 as the tent was flapping in the wind and it was raining earlier than forecast. After listening
to the rain for a while I got up at 05:30 and after eating some more pate and bread donned my waterproof jacket, shorts
and sandals, packed the tent up and set off in the clouds for Windy Gyle which lived up to its name.

![[Wet Weather Walking
Gear](https://flic.kr/p/2qab5cr)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53925068679_7ea777192d_3k.jpg)

There is a large
pile of stones on the summit which is an ancient monument which should not be distubed, not much to look at because of
the low cloud so I continued the descent, which roughly follows the bordere between Scotland and England, glad of my
choice of sandals and shorts because it was very boggy in places.


I came across [Yearning Saddle Refuge Hut][yearning]
and took the opportunity to get out of the wind and rain and eat one of the blueberry snack bars I'd carried. A few
pieces of food had been left for people who might need them along with lots of reminders to take your rubbish with you,
which I had already done bringing my empty beer bottle with me.

![[Yearning Saddle Mountain Refuge](https://flic.kr/p/2qa9gsy)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53924716336_776e063cf6_3k.jpg)
![[Yearning Saddle Lamb Hill](https://flic.kr/p/2qab59a)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53925068489_0ac26f3953_3k.jpg)


Navigation was straight-forward as the trail was well marked with regular way markers and sign-posts although there was
a split with an "alternative" route sign-posted. I opted to stick with the original which followed a "permissive
by-way".

![[A brief lull in the rain](https://flic.kr/p/2qabAZ9)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53925172250_04906ec148_3k.jpg)

Passed a couple of herds of feral goats and met a guy heading north who was on day 46 of hiking from Lands End
to John O'Groats which was pretty impressive. He said that he'd broken a walking pole yesterday and would have to make a
detour to replace it which reminded me that in The Border the previous day I had seen a rack for "_Free walking poles_"
with a single pair hanging so I suggested he could grab try grabbing them from there since the [Scotish National
Trail][snt], Scotlands equivalent of the Pennine Way, starts at The Border and I figured he'd be passing
through. Unfortunately his planned route didn't follow The Way to Kirk Yetholm but he was hopeful he'd be able to pick
another pole up somewhere else.

As I got nearer Bryness I started to see more people, there was one guy off to have a meal in one of the mountain
refuges. He had a long beard which made me wonder whether this was a good insulator against the rain or whether it
helped water ingress into the jacket, not something I'd ever consider with regards to water-proofing. A family group of
four heading north were next and then a couple who were finishing off their journey along The Way having left Edale 16
days previously. They were very friendly and reeled off many of the highlights I would pass, warning that it would
likely be windy on Cross Fell.

![[1990](https://flic.kr/p/2qa9goW)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53924716126_43f5bdd36b_3k.jpg)

I arrived at the [Forest View Inn][fvi] where I had booked to camp for the night around 13:00 having covered the ~25 km
in around six hours but they didn't open for check-in until 16:00. Fortuantely the conservatory was accsessible and
South facing so I was able to warm up and start drying my soaked clothes. My pack had remained dry thanks to the Deuter
rain cover my wife had got me as a birthday present. I was both surprised and pleased with this as previous rain covers
I have had were not very effective at all.

Just before 16:00 a cat appeared at the back door to the conservatory and shortly after Oli appeared and checked me in
(i.e. took my food order for the evening, I opted for Tortellini Pasta bake). Oli and Laura were a lovely welcoming
couple who took over the [Forest View Inn][fvi] bed and breakfast, formerly a Youth Hostel, around four years ago having
got fed up with desk jobs in Manchester. Oli had previously lived in Sheffield on Eccellsal Road and done some climbing
in his time, but was more of a runner these days. He'd attempted both the North and Southern [Spine Race][spinerace]
Challenger twice and completed each once.

![[Forest View Inn](https://flic.kr/p/2qd2Csn)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957370673_74fedc4b85_3k.jpg)

I took the first of several beers that evening and pitched my tent in the back garden, spreading my wet things out over
a picnic bench to dry in the sun, ignoring the fact there was a drying room which is great but fresh air is much more
preferable.

Other guests started to arrive, first was a couple of ladies who were reconnaissancing The Way from Alston to Kirk
Yetholm as one of them, Nicola, would be attempting the Winter [Spine Race][spinerace] for the second time in January
2025 having had to drop out (literally) when she collapsed outside of Alston due to infections in her feet where the
skin had all detached due to a poor choice of overly tight waterproof socks. Her friend Rachel was no slouch on the
racing front either as they had got to know each other whilst running the [Dragons Back][dragonsback] race which
traverses the length of Wales taking in all the 3000 ft peaks. Rachel had not only completed the race, most drop out at
some stage, but had done so after falling on the first day and fracturing her wrist and a rib. Tough and crazy women!

Oli had popped out to retrieve some guests who had stayed the previous night and were doing the remaining section of The
Way over two days, returning to [Forest View Inn][fvi] in-between and returning to finish off the trek to Kirk Yetholm
the following day. This included the family I'd met and a couple I'd passed and a guy from Sheffield who was on his own
and finishing off the trail having started in Edale.

Dinner was communal and very sociable and revolved heavily around the ludicrious experiences Nicola and Rachel had
running ultra-marathons. I had another beer after dinner but headed to bed early around 21:00 shortly after the sun had
set but not before picking up a vegetable pasty and paying for my beer and food.


### Day 3 - Bryness to Hadrians Wall

Slept well but woke early again around 05:00 despite there not being any wind or rain. I didn't hang about too long,
took another shower and was packed and off by 06:50. Ducked into [St Francis' Church][stfrancis] and chatted to a guy
who had spent the night in there. He was hiking around [Kielder Forest][kielder] stopping wherever he fancied.

![[St Francis' Church,
Bryness](https://flic.kr/p/2qd1mw4)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957121951_cb296fa632_3k.jpg)


Wishing him a good time I got back on track and The Way then followed good solid forestry trails through pine forests
for about 15-16km before breaking out onto moorland which I reached in about three hours.

![[Forest Giants](https://flic.kr/p/2qd2CGa)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957371473_a39ead7a13_3k.jpg)_


The moorland wasn't too bad, mainly as it was mostly paved so the few boggy bits weren't a problem. I stepped over what
I thought were some carnivorous plants but was in too much of a hurry to go back and photograph them to check which I
regret now as I didn't see any more.

![[Sturdy Post](https://flic.kr/p/2qaxGZa)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53929289787_187e17f563_3k.jpg)

Didn't pass many people until I was near Bellingham, this was to become something of a theme due to my early starts, but
met a few people heading North along The Way. One guy complemented me on how fast I had been coming down the hill (the
angle helped!) and a very jolly Welsh lady wanted to snap a picture with me to add to her collection she was posting to
Farcebook. There was another solo hiker who had come all the way from Edale who looked fit and happy.

![[Coming or Going](https://flic.kr/p/2qd2CEX)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957371403_35a66b6d6b_3k.jpg)

I reached Bellingham around 13:30 having covered 26km in just over five hours and opted for pizza and beer at [The
Cheviot Hotel][cheviothotel] which was delicious and grabbed some beers for later in the day before setting off on The
Way again.

![[Lunchtime Beer in
Bellingham](https://flic.kr/p/2qaED1N)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53930642210_a4777e12f2_3k.jpg)

I felt good and noticed I'd had a voice in my head telling me to "_engage the core powerhouse_", "_activate
the glutes when stepping forward_" and "_keep the shoulders back and stomach in_" which was Sam Webster, my [pilates
instructor][symmetrypilates] common mantra during the classes I attend. This seemed like good advice as slouching and
lolloping forward would only end in injury so I resolved to make sure I was walking up-right and fully engaging my body
whilst walking for the rest of the hike. Listening to music for the first time since starting hiking I realised this
also helped with the rhythm of walking as did focusing on my breathing (related to actively engaging core and body).

The hiking from Bellingham was fairly mundane, crossing agricultural land before entering another managed forest and
following good tracks through these. Around 17:00 I started keeping an eye out for somewhere to camp, knowing that I
wouldn't make it to the next town I'd planned to stop at, Greenhead, as it was too far away. After leaving the forest
The Way crossed some moorland and in a shallow valley and in the middle was a walled off area with a few trees. This
looked ideal as the walls provided good shelter from the wind which was still hitting me head on from the South, but on
reflection I decided not to stop here because if the wind dropped it would have been midge hell.

![[Good Spot to Camp](https://flic.kr/p/2qaE7Gf)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53930540214_1cf16925ec_3k.jpg)

I continued until I
reached [Cragend by Greenlee Moss][cragend] which gave a brilliant view across the lake as the sun was setting. There
was a convenient stone wall which provided shelter from the wind and after clearing some cow and sheep shit out of the
way I set myself up for the night and set about rehydrating one of the meals I had with me.

![[Stone Wall for shelter](https://flic.kr/p/2qaCvzv)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53930226971_204fd78cf3_3k.jpg)

I'd not really given it much thought as they were [small/far away][fatherted] but the fact I'd had to clear the area of
cow shit to pitch my tent should have rung a bell in my head. It hadn't, but the loud snort of an approaching bell did
so I grabbed my pouch of rehydrating food and put the wall between the bull and myself. It had wandered up with a couple
of calves who started sniffing around my stove which I'd left out and I gently shooed them away from the safety of the
wall. Fortunately the bull was taking more of an interest in a female the other side of the fence. After a stand-off of
about five minutes they all lost interest in me (or perhaps the lack of food which I'd eaten) and wandered off which was
my opportunity to quickly take the tent down and move onto a safer spot, recalling the devestation cows had wrecked on
some neighbours tents whilst I was in Peru 2012.

![[Company](https://flic.kr/p/2qaEfLM)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53930567389_d81a62c9bc_3k.jpg)


It was starting to get dark as I headed over to [Rapishaw Gap][rapishaw] on Hadrians Wall and heading towards Milking
gap I started scoping for a flat place to pitch my tent, regretting not going up the other side of Rapishaw Gap where
there looked like a nice sheltered spot, but I didn't have to go far until I found a spot and re-pitched my tent. As I
was finishing off I was startled by a guy passing by who said it looked like a nice spot to camp. He'd been out running
but had lost track of time watching the sunset but didn't have too far to go to get back.

![[A night on Hadrians Wall](https://flic.kr/p/2qaxSgG)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53929321022_df58b11acb_3k.jpg)


I was tired after around 50 km of hiking so crawled into the tent and fell asleep quickly.

### Day 4 - Hadrians Wall to Garigill

Woke early and stuck my head out of the tent to a beautiful sunrise along the line of the wall.

![[Sunrise on Hadrians Wall](https://flic.kr/p/2qd1nf8)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957124391_2513134848_3k.jpg)


Didn't hang around too
long, collapsed the tent and packed everything away fairly quickly to avoid getting in trouble for camping on (next to)
an ancient monument. I don't eat breakfast so off we went on the undulations of Hadrians Wall. Quickly reached the
famous [Sycamore Gap][sycamoregap] passing a couple of climbers who were also camping/bivvying on the wall to make the
walk-in to the crag extremely short.

Being up and walking early is lovely, its quiet and there aren't many people about so it was nice avoiding whatever
crowds were to arrive later in the day. There were a few like minded people about, one lady commenting the exact same
thing, another walking from Cawfields to Sycamore Gap who had waved from across a gap. The countryside is really quite a
friendly place, especially for those out on their own.

[Toilets][cawfields] at Cawfields Lake were very welcome and there was also fresh water available which was useful for
the coming day. Hadrians Wall petters out here and crosses some farmland where I met a couple of guys heading North on
The Way and encouraged them onwards as they didn't have too far to go compared to how far they come, which reminded me
how much further I still had to go.

Passing through [Walltown Quarry][walltownquarry] which has been beautifully transformed into a small nature reserve I
stopped in the shop and grabbed a can of Sprite to drink to keep my energy up as I had decided not to detour into
Greenhead in search of food (this turned out to be a mistake) and instead carried on passing [Thirlwall
Castle][thirlwallcastle], although as I had a long way to go I only snapped a picture from outside and didn't explore
the grounds. As you cross the railway line shortly after [Thirlwall View][thirlwallview] had a little honesty tuck shop
for hikers of The Way to re-supply. I didn't have any change so only took pictures rather than some food. Such tuck
shops were to crop up a number of times along The Way and it was lovely to see how generous and helpful people could be
towards strangers.

I survived a game of [Frogger][frogger] on the A69 but was mildly alarmed by the sign on the gate which warned of
biological hazards, although they only seemed to apply to those who undertaking work on telephone masts! The next few
kilometers were fairly mundane going gently uphill through grazed fields and low lying moorland. After a couple of hours
though and not having had any food I was starting to get tired, my feet were hurting and my pace slowed. It became hard
work going up hill and for the first time in four days I wasn't really enjoying myself. I hoped there would be somewhere
to get a snack in Slaggyford but alas not but as I was planning to get to Garigill for the night and had to pass through
Alston so figured I'd be able to eat on the way through. Looking at the map I decided that I wasn't going to do what
appeared to be a fairly mundane loop out across a hillside and instead head along the road into Alston.

Just after leaving the road the smell of chips frying wafted up the road from [The Nook][thenook] and I knew instantly
where I would be eating. They had burger night on so I ordered a delicious chicken burger which came with a healthy
portion of chipps and quaffed a couple of cans of lemon Fanta. Feeling tired I asked staff if there was anywhere to camp
in Alston, they didn't think so but asked another customer who was local who confirmed this but advised to "_just camp
on the village green, no one will care and lots of people do it_". I thanked the staff and locals for advice and taking
their advice shouldered the pack and crossed the adjacent field to reach a track that ran along the [South Tynedale
Railway][tynedalerailway] which was a nice compact and flat trail into Alston and took me from Northumberland into
Cumberland.

Feelin invigorated by the food I stopped in the Alston House Hotel for a pint and after grabbing some supplies
(viz. beer, sweets and lunch for the next day) set off up hill to my original target for the day, Garigill. I'd read
about a diversion because the [Dryburn Bridge was closed due to flood damage][dryburn] which took me a long an
alternative trail on the north side of the river which didn't look as though it had seen much traffic and involved
hacking through shoulder height ferns in the fading light.

As I entered Garigill I met a lady out walking her dog who asked if I was intending on camping behind the village hall
which I was. She advised me I might want to look elsewhere as there was a wedding reception in the hall that evening and
suggested a spot down by the river which would be quieter. Again I was surprised at how welcoming and helpful people
were to those trekking The Way and thanked her for her advice. I was too tired to go looking for alternatives though so
when I got to the village hall spoke to a couple of guys outside having cigarettes saying I had been hoping to camp out
the back that evening. They said I should just go through and pitch up and that I could even join the party and have
some curry which was very generous but I was satiated and tired and just wanted to go to bed so I went through and
pitched my tent in the far corner under a tree, had a beer and showed some curious children from the wedding what my
tent was like then went to bed. A short while later I was woken though as some of the kids decided to use my tent as a
target for throwing plastic bottles and cans at. I didn't bother rising to the bate and stayed quiet in my tent. The
music stopped around 23:00 and I heard some arguing (alcohol and families often result in high emotions) but at least
the shower of plastic bottles and cans had stopped and I soon drifted off to sleep.

### Day 5 - Garigill to High Cup Nick

Slept until about 06:30 as I had a relatively short day planned going up and over Cross Fell, down into Dufton and on to
[High Cup Nick][highcupnick]. I collected the rubbish that had been thrown at my tent and put it in the recycling and
chatted to a lady who was tidying up after last nights reception. Turns out it was the bride who hadn't been able to
sleep knowing that she had to tidy up so she'd got up early to get started with the job.

I had a shower, after clearing up what broken glass from the night before that I could see on the floor and managed to
avoid cutting my feet which would have been bad for hiking. Dropped some cash in the honesty box (aka letter box) packed
up and set off heading up Cross Fell. The path was a good compact track, no doubt for the grouse shooting that went on
up on the moor.

After winding my way up the hill side the beautiful [Gregs Hut][gregshut] came into view and I poked my head in to have
a look around before continuing. Will definitely have to come back and spend at least one night here in the future.

A short steep section led to the plateau of Cross Fell with its excellent stone shelter from the wind and another trig
point. There was a party of three with a couple of dogs who had hiked up from Dufton for the day when I arrived and we
chatted briefly. I had a beer before snapping a panorama and heading off and over Great Dun Fell with its listening
station on the summit like a golf ball poised to be driven south over the A66. The path then headed down into Dufton
where I had been planning on eating at the [The Stag Inn][staginn]. Arriving just after 16:00 I had to wait
until 17:00 until food was served and was told I couldn't look at the menu in advance as there was a party of eight
booked in and they were taking priority so I would have to order after them. In the end the party (two families) turned
up late and by 17:15 hadn't decided what they wanted to eat so I was allowed to order ahead of them (as had a number of
other people who were eating but hadn't been waiting as long as I had). Not the friendliest of service I came across but
the food was ok.

It was getting late and in my rush to set off and get to [High Cup Nick][highcupnick] I set off without my walking
poles. I didn't get far before realising this so dashed back to the pub to grab them and set off at a decent pace to
climb back up the hill, passing a pair who had walked from Middleton in Teesdale that day heading North along The
Way. The 6km and ~300m of ascent (most of which are in the first 2-3km) were accomplished quickly (just over an hour)
and I found myself coming onto the rim of the amazing [High Cup Nick][highcupnick], a valley with a dolerite rim with
limestone above and below the layer of dolerite. As I neared the head I kept my eyes open for a flat spot to camp, not
wanting to pitch up at the very top where it was boggier and there would be more midges if the wind dropped (needn't
have worried, the wind barely stopped the whole trip!).

I snapped a few pictures in the fading light then setup my tent for the night and went to sleep almost instantly.

### Day 6 - High Cup Nick to Middleton in Teesdale

Wet, misty and windy this morning, I'd made the right decision heading up the previous night to see [High Cup
Nick][highcupnick] in all its glory as I couldn't see much of it this morning. Packed the tent up and was off quickly,
looking forward to a short day of 28km almost exclusively downhill along the edge of the Maize Beck then the River Tees
to Middleton in Teeside.

![[Wrapped Up |

Crossed a bridge that had been erected in memory of Ken Wilson and followed a good compact
track downhill passing through Birksdale Farm and shortly after coming on to the fantastic view of the
confluence of Maize Beack and River Tees. The trail swings by underneath the dam of [Cow Green Reservoir][cowgreen] and
down the side of [Cauldron Snout][caulrdonsnout] which was in full flow and very impressive.

The Way then follows the River Tees all the way to Middleton on Tees side. Heading down this section I met a lady
heading North along The Way, the first solo female hiker I'd met. She had set off early and was keen to reach Dufton
before the forecast rain passed through, just as I was keen to reach Middleton.

After passing through Cronkley farm I came across what seemed like a Juniper forest with lots of small stout
evergreens that looked to me like Juniper, something I've encountered on cliff faces over the years climbing but never
seen a forest of. [Force Garth Quarry][garthquarry] was passed and very soon I arrived above [High Force
Waterfall][highforce] which was quite spectacular. Snapped a few shots from above then went round to the viewing area
from the South to get some shots, waiting to get into position as there were a lot of people about, including a
school/youth group.

Plodding along down hill the sound of the water bubbling over waterfalls was too tempting and I opted to cool my feet
off in the cold water. It was delightful and I wish I had done it earlier. If you can stand it for long enough it
rejunivates the feet, taking down swelling (the longer you stay in the more swelling goes down) and is just a delightful
contrast to pounding the floor.

[Low Force][lowforce] came very soon after with the [something suspension bridge][] which strongly advised not to have
more than one person on it at any given time which I and others duly respected. A little further along the trail I met a
couple out for a short walk who asked if I was walking the Pennine Way (the big rucksack and poles are a bit of a
giveaway) we chatted and it transpired they were from Sheffield and occasionally drank in [The Brothers
Arms][brothersarms] had just passed a pair who were also hiking from North to South who were also from Sheffield and who
one of them knew. This was a first! I'd almost caught up some other Wayfarers heading South! I said farewell and as my
feet were sore though so I decided to cool them off in the River Tees. Refreshed I resolved to catch up the pair from
Sheffield and a short while later I came across two people with rucksacks who had stopped for a short break. It was the
two Wayfarers who were heading South, I said I was heading the same way too as I lived in Sheffield so it was like
walking home (knowing full well this was likely to be the pair from Sheffield). They were indeed from Sheffield and we
came round to where abouts we lived, I said Meersbrook and one of them asked if I drank in [The Brothers
Arms][brothersarms] which I do and he then asked where I lived. Transpires one of them, Martin who was 70, lives at
number 59 on the same road as me! His friend had walked the Pennine Way many years ago when he was 17 and Martin had
tried a year after lockdown but had aborted so they had joined forces to complete the way again. We posed for a picture
and resolved to catch up when we were both back in Sheffield.

It was only a short distance to [Middleton on Teesdale][middleton] where I noticed [Ozzys Pizza][ozzys] on the way into
town but headed straight to the pub for a couple of mid-afternoon pints in [The Forresters][forresters] and wrote up some
over-due notes in my diary and charged by phone and camera. A guy, Dave, playing darts and pools asked if I needed
somewhere to camp for the night and said it would be fine to pitch up in the yard of his portaloo company. I thanked him
for the offer but politely declined saying I wanted to have a shower, very friendly pub and people. Suitably refreshed I
swung by the Co-Op for some beers and sweets and headed back out of town to [Daleview][daleview] where I met Andy and
Alex who were heading North on The Way. Andy knew lots about The Pennine Way as he volunteered to work on [The Spine
Race][spinerace] and mentioned the Middleton Tandoori which piqued my interest as I love curry. Unfortunately this was
only a transient restaurant that was setup to feed participants and volunteers. Andy proudly told me he'd eaten 12
portions of Chicken Korma one year but seemed put out that this coming year they had moved the station and said that he
would not be able to indulge to quite such an extent. Alex was closer to my age, probably a bit younger and we agreed to
head into town to grab a pizza for dinner that evening from Ozzy's which was delicious (we invited Andy but he passed,
favouring his own food).

Alex was a software engineer with a degree in computer science but was also learning about horticulture, initially to
grow produce but more recently had got interested in ornamental plants. We popped back to The Forresters after pizza for
another pint and to charge devices before heading back to the campsite for the night.

### Day 7 - Middleton in Teesdale to Thwaite

Big day as I was hoping to get to Hawes in one big push stopping for lunch at the [Tan Hill Inn][tanhillinn], England's
highest pub. It was unfortunately drizzling when I woke up early but I forced myself out of the tent and packed it away,
noticing that Andy had the foresight to bring a cloth to wipe his tent down and get most of the moisture off of it

I'd made an organisational error and didn't get snacks (i.e. sweets to chomp on whilst hiking) from the Co-op the previous
night after pizza and beers with Alex so after packing everything up I hiked into town to grab some more Haribo Starmix
before setting off on The Way in light drizzle. Gentle arable land rolled past with a couple of tuck shops passed on the
way, one of which had Irn-Bru cans for sale which I took advantage of for an energy boost later on. [Grassholme
Reservoir][grassholme] was quickly passed. Coming over Beck Head there was a barn owl circling around the field, it
seemed to be struggling to gain height and escape in the strong wind that was blowing as it circled the area multiple
times. I thought I glimpsed someone walking ahead of me in the same direction with a red bag but lost sight of them
quickly even though I should have had a clear view of them as I dropped down into the valley with [Blackton
Reservoir][blackton] as the path went up the hillside opposite. I soon caught up with them though as  they had
stopped for a break just past Clove Lodge. It was a lady called Jolyene from Ireland who was a locum vet in Cornwall who
was doing The Way in sections with her dog (who's name I forget). We fell into step and talked for a while, losing the
path as we headed up Peatbrig Hill. She was looking to redress the balance in her life and spend more time doing the
things she enjoyed, running (when the body allowed), travelling with friends and family and her main passion
surfing. Around Race Yate she stopped to give her dog some water and said she couldn't keep pace.

I carried on dropping down to cross the A66 which was a little weird as its somewhere I drive along when heading to
Keswick. It was quite noisy due to the traffic, a complete contrast to the quiet hills and dales I'd been walking over
the last week and  even the villages I passed through. Just south of the A66 was a small farm and a sign for "[God's
Bridge][godsbridge]" a natural limestone bridge over the River Greta. There wasn't much water flowing but it was very
cool. If I hadn't been in such a rush I might have investigated more, but I still had a long way to go to get to Hawes.

Following the track up from River Greta I met a father and son who were on day six or seven heading North on The Way. We
had a brief chat and they asked how I was getting on in sandals and shorts which I'd opted for that day as it had been
raining when I set off and I knew I had the bog that leads up to Tan Hill to contend with. I was quite happy walking in
sandals and felt they worked well.

The Way then followed a good shooting track for a few kilometers up the slope towards Tan Hill but eventually petered
out. As I left the trail I met two older ladies who were also following The Way North but had taken the sensible option
of having their kit sherpa'd ahead each day so they had the luxury of walking with lighter day sacks. Not a bad idea at
all I thought as I checked how heavy my pack felt. There were a series of good wooden sign-posts with white painted tops
that marked the way through the bog to Tan Hill summit and the highest pub in England. Near the top I saw a couple in
the middle of the moor and bog disagreeing about which way to go as they tried to get back on the path. As I met them it
was clear they weren't british and I advised them to follow the marker posts and ignore the smaller plastic ones which I
think they had mistakenly started following and had taken them off-track as these were markers for grouse feeders.

On arrival at the [Tan Hill Inn][tanhillinn] I popped in to ask if it would be ok to pitch my tent so it could dry in
the wind and sun whilst I had lunch and duly did so before settling down to an expensive pint and scampi and chips which
was good but probably a bit over-priced too in my opinion. No time for a second pint (the queue at the bar precluded
this) so I packed up the now dry tent and set off on a good track towards East Stronsdale, gradually losing
height. Upper [East Gill Force][eastgillforce] was passed and The Way then headed up an interestingly paved path up
Kisdon hill before skirting around over jumbled limestone blocks. Traversing Kisdon Hill gave some stunning views into
[Swaledale][swaledale], unfortunately at this point a heavy shower passed over but as it was late in the day I had the
delight of a rainbow over Black Hill. Dropping down into [Thwaite][thwaite] there were more black clouds looming over
Dam Hill and Great Shunner Fell so I decided to not push on to Hawes that evening and instead stop in the campsite I'd
seen in the valley. Not before having a beer though so I popped into an empty [Kearton House][keartonhouse] only to be
told that they weren't open and the only reason the door was unlocked was because the solicitors had just visited.  I
was advsed I might be able to get a beer at Usha Campsite where I was heading as they had a small shop so I walked the
kilometre or so down the road only to find I was too late in the day as the shop, and reception in general, had closed
an hour and a half earlier.

Pitched the tent in a field in the lee of a wall and large tree after carefully looking for dead branches that might
come down in high wind and deciding it was relatively unlikely to happen. A quick shower then boiled some water to make
dinner. There were a number of Duke of Edinbrough participants who were hiking around the area and I chatted to a few
of the as I ate my rehydrated meal in the warmth and comfort of the facilities. They were bemoaning having to hike 20km
or so, but to be fair they were having to carry all of their food, unlike mysel who was making good use of all of the
eateries I was passing.

Pretty tired so had an early night, but not before a few more showers passed through which helped me feel vindicated in
my decision not to push on to Hawes that evening.


### Day 8 - Thwaite to Horton in Ribblesdale

Up early (there is a theme here!) and packing the tent away I left before most of the Duke of Edinbrough hikers were
up. Reception wasn't open so I went to post my £10 through the letter box just as a lady was sorting reception for the
day. She was very grateful and wished me luck on my days hiking.

I found a path along Muker Beck back to Thwaite which was a lot more pleasant the following the road I'd come down the
previous evening and had soon passed through Thwaite and started heading up Dam Hill on a good compact farm track. This
turned to flagstones as the path joined the open moorland and I had a good target to reach of a prominent cairn. I find
setting myself short targets of reaching feature X or the other side of the valley in a certain number of minutes a good
motivational way to keep moving quickly. Within no time I found I'd reached the cairn and paused to snap some pictures
looking back down [Swaledale][swaledale] before continuing over Great Shunner Fell. There were great views to the North
West but some ominous grey clouds were looming on the horizon so I didn't hang around too long admiring the view,
instead dropping down quickly to reach Hawes for lunch. This section was longer than I expected and only server to
reassure me I'd made the right decision the previous night not to tackle it in the fading light.

Passing through [Hardraw][hardraw] I was tempted to duck into The Green Dragon for a pint but mindful of the grey skies I
kept on going to [Hawes][hawes] instead where there were more options for lunch. In hindsight I wish I had stopped as it
is home to England's highest waterfall, [Hardraw Force][hardrawforce] which I didn't know about, although you have to
pay to access it which would likely have put me off.

A shower passed as I made my way to [Hawes][hawes] which is a lovely village in [Wensleydale][wensleydale]. None of the
pubs opened until mid-day so instead I opted for lunch in [The Wensleydale Pantry][wensleydalepantry] which turned out
to be an excellent choice as I had a delicious Thai vegetable Penang curry. Replenished I grabbed some sweets and a can
of beer and set off out the west of the village pausing outside of St Margaret's Church to put on waterproof trousers as
it had started to drizzle. This was just a passing shower and I soon stopped to remove the trousers as I was
sweating. Onwards and upwards passing near the summit of Ten End (584m) I joined the Cam Road with excellent views over
the valley to the west. By now it had started drizzling again but the wall by the side of Cam Road provided some shelter
(the rain was coming in from the side rather than above) and I didn't think much of it as I passed by Dodd Fell Hill
(668m). As I started dropping down into Ribblesdale though I realised I was quite wet now and the rain showed no signs
of letting up. There was no point in putting waterproofs on now though so I plodded on downhill.

There was a random caravan just off of Cam High Road and as I continued a cyclist passed me coming up the road. We said
hello but he looked like he was in a hurry and carried on. I noticed his cycling shorts had a big hole in them on the
right thigh suggesting he'd come off earlier in the day. I left Cam High Road following Cam Road, crossing Cam Beck and
Calf Holes, skirting farmland. I was thoroughly soaked by now and finding it pretty miserable for the second time of the
hike and resolved to find somewhere dry to stay for the night in [Horton in Ribblesdale][horton]. Eventually I arrived
in town and immediately sort shelter in [The Crown][hortoncrown] where there were a couple of guys who had just
completed the [Yorkshire Three Peaks][yorkshirethreepeaks] and were waiting for the friends to join them. After
finishing my pint I set about trying to find a B&B to stay in and there appeared to be one on the far side of town so I
trekked over in the rain. There weren't many cars outside which made me hopeful they'd have space but after knocking on
the door (twice) a lady answered and said they didn't have a room that evening. I asked if she could recommend anywhere
and was advised to try [Settle][settle] which I could get to by train so I walked back to the train station which was
closed but found a small area out of the rain to check what was available online. The cheapest place was around £100-120
which was way outside my budget and didn't include the cost of the train, nor the hassle of being so far off route the
next morning so I resigned myself to a wet night in the tent and wandered back towards [The Crown][hortoncrown] checking
out the National Trust toilet block and grass as a possible place to pitch before returning to the pub and ordering a
bowl of chips and another pint to console myself. I then did what I should have done in the first instance which was ask
the barman if there was anywhere to stay in town and he advised me that there was another pub [The Golden Lion
Hotel][hortongoldenlion] just past the campsite (which I hadn't actually located yet!) and that they had a bunkhouse and
rooms but that they often shut early if they were quiet. My chips arrived and I couldn't finish them quick enough before
shouldering my pack and heading down the road to check out this lifeline. A Ukrainian woman was behind the bar but had
only been working there five days so wasn't sure about how the bunkhouse worked but they had space. With the assistance
of what I presume was the landlord I was checked in and given the code to access the room. No one else was there so I
draped my wet clothes and kit out over the beds in the hope they would dry a little overnight (there wasn't any real
heating and no dry room as far as I could tell).

After a quick shower I went back down to the bar where I got chatting to Roger who was heading North on The Way and had
only found the pub and bunkhouse after he had pitched his tent next door at the campsite. He didn't seem too phased by
the wet weather and told me he'd walked The Pennine Way many years ago when he was 17, but that he couldn't remember any
of it. Whilst we were chatting a guy came into the bar decked out in cycling gear looking to stay in the
bunkhouse, I thought he was cycle touring and, like me, needed a place to shelter for the night. Having just been
checked in I helped show him where it was and entered the code to get in even though he had  been chatting to the bar
staff in what sounded like her native language.

Time was called at the bar relatively early, around 21:30 so I said farewell to Roger and wished him luck on the rest of
his hike and retired to the bunkhouse where I got to know [Daniil Sadomskij][daniil] who wasn't just cycle touring, he
was competing in the [GBDuro 2024][gbduro24] and was on his fifth day of cycling from Lands End to Cape Wrath via Wales,
The Pennine Bridleway. It sounded brutal and would explain the cyclists I passed earlier in the day. Dani was currently
placed fourth but it wasn't about winning for him as his main motivation was to see the country as he'd been living in
the UK for eight years working as a chef in a London restaurant. He had an excellent pair of Lidl shorts and was eating
some cold, congealed chips he'd picked up earlier in the day. This didn't look very appetising so I offered him one of
my dehydrated meals which he gratefully accepted and after boiling the kettle and a short wait he had some warm pasta
and salmon to help him recover from the days exertions and fuel him for the next days.

He was a really nice guy, engaged to be married to a Welsh lady and enthusiastic about cycling. We were both tired
though and planned to get up early, although he said he was going to set his alarm for 04:00 and make an early start
which didn't bother me as I could doze a bit afterwards.


### Day 9 - Horton in Ribblesdale to Gargrave

Still raining when I was woken early by Daniil's alarm. Knowing he'd set it early I didn't bother to look at the time
and dozed instead listening to it going off repeatedly. When I finally looked at the time it was 06:50 so I got up and
let Daniil know that he'd missed his early start. He wasn't too bothered, saying that if the body needs rest it needs
rest. We both slowly packed up our kit which was still slightly damp and he sensibly did some stretching before posing
for a picture. We wished each other good luck and he and jumped on his bike and set off, rejoining the Pennine Bridleway
heading ultimately to Cape Wrath.

I was packed and ready to head out into the wind and rain shortly after and with nothing to keep me hanging around brace
myself for the onslaught and headed out. Not sure there was much that could have prepared me for the battering the wind
and rain gave me as I headed up [Pen y Ghent][penyghent], it was brutal! The rain was heavy and coming in horizontal as
I gained height and I passed a couple who I'd seen in the car park of the pub who had decided not to continue which
seemed wise, they were in shorts and pretty basic trainers. The higher I got the stronger the wind blew and I chatted to
a guy who said he'd been out wild camping for the night (nutter!). On the final path up to the summit plateau the wind
really kicked in though and I was very grateful of having my walking poles to help stabilise me. Even then I was still
struggling to walk in a straight line and remain upright! The plateau itself provided some respite as the wind wasn't
hitting the side of the hill and being driven upwards and there was a shelter (viz. wall) near the summit trig point. A
couple who had come up the way I was due to descend arrived and said it was pretty windy and wet on the path. There was
no point hanging around so I got on with descending out of the horrendous wind. The rocks were wet, as predicted several
days ago, but weren't that bad to negotiate (hands were employed for safety). The loss of altitude was accompanied by
some easing off of the wind, but not by much. As I skirted round Cow Hill though the weather seemed to ease a bit, with
both the rain and wind dying down a bit and the cloud base lifting a little. I unfortunately had to head up and over
[Fountains Fell (668m)][fountainsfell] so up I went again. The weather was definitely improving as it wasn't anywhere
near as windy or wet as [Pen y Ghent][penyghent] had been although the views remained non-existent.

Soon I was dropping down and passing through farmland and making my way to skirt the long way round [Malham
Tarn][malhamtarn] where the wind was whipping across and making quite a few waves. Somewhere to return to in the future
as it was very picturesque (like so many other places on the hike!). The sun was out in force by now so I stripped down
to shorts and hung my waterproofs from my arm to dry in the wind which worked pretty quickly as I could pack them away
before starting the descent to [Malham Cove][malhamcove]. I passed a couple of young ladies out for a walk as I
descended from Malham Moor and skirted under Watlowes. They seemed impressed by my progress and said they would have to
try hiking The Way which I thoroughly recommended they do. The limestone pavement above [Malham Cove][malhamcove] was
impressive and had attracted those fit enough to climb the stairs up from the bottom of the Cove. I was getting hungry
by now so after a few pictures I descended the steps, picking up a Red Bull can along the way and passed many people out
for the day as I made a beeline for [The Lester Arms][lesterarms] where I had a mushroom and black bean burger with
wedges and beer battered onion rings. Chatted to a few others who were having a drink and explained how useful I found
walking poles to a couple, as the lady had had operations on her knees which were weak as a consequence.

Satiated and watered I set off for Gargrave, tracking the [River Aire][aire] as it wound its way down the dale. This
took me most of the way, but I parted company and was taken over a couple of hills via some fields with cows in which
weren't bothered by my presence. I very soon came to Gargrave and headed to the Co-op to get a few beers for the evening
before back-tracking to [Eshton Road Caravan Park][eshton] where a lovely old gentleman pointed me to a small enclosed
field to camp for the night. A beer whilst pitching the tent close to the wall so it was sheltered from the storm thatw
as forecast to come through overnight and my appetite was whet so I headed back into town to eat at [The Frying
Yorkshireman][fryingyorkshireman] which was excellent both in terms of food and service. Very friendly, big portions of
delicious food and a boot shaped glass for the beer. If you're ever in Gargrave and need to eat head here you won't be
disappointed. Back to the tent for another beer (cheaper than the pub!) and an early night.

Chatted to a friendly guy on the campsite who I'd seen eating fish and chips opposite the chippy whilst I snapped
pictures of the antiquated pharmacy and then got an early night.

### Day 10 - Gargrave to Colden

Woken early around 05:00 by the wind and rain of [Storm Lilian][lilian] passing through, it was pretty windy and on
checking the satellite imagery it was due to rain heavily between 06:00 and 07:00 and decided to stay in bed and ride
that out rather than take the tent down in the rain. Forecast was spot on and my tent was almost flattened by some
_very_ strong gusts about 06:30. Fortunately its design (an older version of the [Wild Country Zephyros 1][zephyros])
with a single pole meant it sprung back up pretty quickly and I weathered the storm ok. On rising it was clear that some
of the other campers hadn't fared so well. There was a camper van with the air-beam awning collapsed, but that was
because they had been savvy enough to do it themselves _before_ the wind took it away. Unfortunately the awning to the
caravan of the guy I'd chatted to the previous night was nowhere to be seen.

After packing my kit up I set off to the Co-op to get supplies for the day but as I crossed the road I realised I hadn't
seen my wallet so checked my pockets and those of my rucksack and then realised I'd left it on the floor of the tent and
packed it away inside! Wasted five minutes retrieving it from inside whilst next to the canal and packing it all back up
again. This proved a bit of a waste of time as on arrival at the Co-op the lights were out and the door was shut with a
sign on the window saying there had been a power cut and they weren't open. I managed to get the attention of a member
of staff and asked where the nearest place shop was. After establishing that I couldn't hear a word she was saying
through the shut door she cracked it open and advised me it was 10 minutes drive down the road in Skipton, clearly not
paying any attention to the rucksack on my back and walking poles I was carrying!

I resigned myself to having to make a detour later on and set off for the day crossing open farmland and winding my way
through a few country lanes where I encountered a tree that had been felled by the wind. Fortuantely it only slowed me
down for a minute or so as I negotiated the branches and soon I found myself walking along a section of the canal where
I came across a cool two-storey bridge.

In [Thornton in Craven][thornton] I asked a gentleman who was rescuing his bin where the nearest shop was. Unfortunately
there weren't any shops in Thornton, the nearest was [Earby][earby] which was off-route, but I needed some food for the
day so crossed a couple of fields, noticing that the Colne and Broughton/Skipton Road was closed due to another tree
that had come down and there was a queue of lorries backing up into Earby as they had no way of turning around on the
narrow lanes. [Earby][earby] had the usual Co-op and supplies for the day were purchased along with a "Yorkshire Slice"
from a local bakery where I instantly regretted not buying my lunch from there instead of the Co-op.

I soon rejoined The Way and headed up to Pinhaw Beacon where there was a memorial to those who had died in the COVID19
Pandemic written to a Shakespeare sonnet. I was saddened to see some idiots had vandalised the tribute to the NHS at the
end. Some people have no idea how fortunate they are to have free, world leading, health-care in this country.

After dropping down into Lothersdale and out again I met a guy who was walking from Dover to Cape Wrath and was
currently on day 20. He was a talker and regaled going through London rather than round it camping near some football
stadium and many other facets of his 20 days to get to that point. Mindful of the time I wished him well and carried on
as I still had a long way to go.

I'd hoped there would be a pub near The Way in Ikornshaw but alas no so up Green Hill I went. As I reached the edge of
the moors there appeared to be a collection of extreme sheds dotted along the edge. Perhaps these were for game keepers
but there were a lot of them. There was a guy working outside of one and he took the time to calm his dog as I passed
but I didn't think to ask him what the sheds were for or why there were so many. The moorland opened up and I met a lady
who was out for a run, we had a brief chat about how nice a day it was and she mentioned she had just passed another
person who was hiking the Pennine Way and heading South, this was a surprise and I decided to quicken my pace and see if
I could catch them up. On the top of the moor I met two ladies who were heading north independently, the second was
suffering from a very sore knee which she suspected was due to the weight of her pack and not being sufficiently fit. I
advised getting some poles if possible to help and carried on, dropping down and passing Ponden Reservoir then up and
over to Within Heights where an abandoned farm was a possible an inspiration for Emily Bronte's _Wuthering Heights_, a
book I've never read and likely never will. Good flagstones led to Walshaw Dean Reservoirs which were skirted round and
Lower Gorple Reservoir passed quickly. Traversing the moor of Standing Stone Hill was straight forward and I soon
dropped down into [Colden][colden] where I easily found the [The New Delight Inn][newdelight] with the [Hebden Bridge
Camping][hebdencamping] adjacent. I wandered into the busy pub which had a lovely community vibe, lots of people milling
around chatting and was asked if I was looking to camp for the night (I can't think what gave that away!) and quickly
directed to a lady sat with friends who happily took my £20 note and gave me a warm £10 she had extracted from her
bra. The setup was simple as there was a small field next to the car park, flat at the bottom with toilets outside the
pub and one person already camped there.

Heading over I dumped the pack and said hello to the other camper who happened to be the person the runner had met
earlier in the day. His name was Mike and he was busy enjoying his dinner and avoiding the midges. We had a brief chat
about how long we had been hiking and I left him to his dinner to pitch my tent before it got dark and return to the pub
to get food and beer. The pub didn't actually serve food, beyond the usual bar snacks of crisps and nuts which would
often do me fine but tonight I needed something more substantial and was in luck as there was a takeaway in Hebden
Bridge that delivered. Connected to the WiFi I placed my order and settled down with a pint to write up my notes for the
past few days as I'd fallen behind. I was unfortunately quite tired, the light wasn't great and I didn't have my glasses
which I find I'm needing more frequently these days, but I got some notes written before the pizza arrived which was
delicious.

I had a big day planned as I wanted to pass Standing Edge where there wasn't much accommodation, and push through to
Crowden in a single big day which would leave me with "just" Bleaklow and Kinder to pass to get to Edale and so suitably
satiated I headed to bed early. Thankfully the kids playing outside the pub whilst their parents drank and chatted
didn't use my tent for target practice this time.

### Day 11 - Colden to Crowden

Up early, again, but not as early as Mike who said hello as he set off, he thought I might catch him up though, having
done so over the past few days. Tent away and I hit the trail again, heading down a lovely path above Colden
Water. I wasn't paying attention though and made a minor navigational error missing the turning and only realised 500m
down the hill in the woods adding an unnecessary kilometre to the days hiking and having to turn around and head back up
hill to find The Way which followed a very narrow, overgrown path between dry stone walls of fields before dropping
steeply down into Calder Valley. I had been thinking about getting some food here but as I approached the River Calder I
saw a heron in the middle of the river and completely forgot to look for food as I snapped as many pictures as I could
before it flew off. Happy to have got some half decent shots, given the lack of zoom on my camera, I started the long
slog out of the valley to [Stoodley Pike][stoodleypike]. This section had looked steep but the path followed farm tracks
and wound its way through woods and some fields before the final steep section onto the edge of the moor. Before this
last steep bit I paused to sort out my clothing as it looked like it was about to start raining and spied what I thought
was Mike passing [Stoodley Pike][stoodleypike]. Its an impressive monument and I took the time to climb the 39 steps
that take you to the balcony and snap some overcast shots in each of the ordinal directions.

Continuing along The Way I met a group out for an early hike approaching from the opposite direction and followed the
flagstones across the moor to Warland Reservoir which was looking a bit empty. I was gaining on Mike now and was able to
go quickly as the track was flat and my legs were strong from the past ten days of hiking. Blackstone Edge Reservoir and
[The White House][whitehouse] came into view and were quickly passed and as I started to head up to [Blackstone
Edge][blackstoneedge] I caught up with Mike who had paused to check his navigation and we walked and chatted as we went
up to the edge. He said I should carry on as I was faster but after checking out the largest buttress for routes I was
happy to walk and chat with him which made a change from the last ten days of being with my own thoughts.

Mike was easy to chat to, he is retired but worked on oil rigs off the coast of Norfolk after responding to an advert
in a paper for mechanically minded people to transfer into the area. He'd worked his way up through the different
levels, for a time having his own company and had lived in the US for a period with a lady he was with for a while. On
returning to work after the COVID pandemic he decided he didn't want to do that any more and after seeing a financial
consultant he realised he could take early retirement and who would blame him. He enjoyed getting out walking and seeing
the countryside with his dog Rufus who he clearly loved a lot and was pleased to be fit and able to enjoy his retirement
unlike many of his friends who were still working or had heart conditions or other physical ailments which prevented
them from doing so.

We soon passed over the M62 and both found the noise and bustle quite jarring compared to the peace and solitude we'd
experienced hiking over fells and moorland but quickly left it behind and returned to peace and quiet. As we neared a
road the possibility of lunch loomed in the form of a small cafe in a container by the side of the road but
unfortunately they were closed. We were both sadden to see there appeared to be some people living in tents around this
layby and the rise in homelessness is another poor reflection on the previous governments performance.

We soon reached the road near Standedege and Marsden where I had abandoned a previous attempt to walk the Pennine Way
from South to North a number of years ago and stopped on a convenient rock for lunch. Mike had a wrap and some cheese
whilst I broke out my stove and reheated my penultimate dehydrated meal for lunch. The stove is super efficient and I
was soon tucking into the hotpot mash which was tasty but as always with these meals there is a tiny bit that never gets
the water it needs. Mike set off before me and 15 minutes later I'd packed everything away and hit the path again
myself.

I noticed the Great Western Inn had a number of caravans outside it and this must have been the pub that someone had
told me was a cheap campsite to stay at, but I was pushing on to Crowden so I had a relatively easy day into Edale on my
last day. This first section to was nice going over moorland, passing between Black Moss and Swellands reservoir before
dropping down and crossing Wessenden Brook and passing along the side of Wessenden and Wessenden Head reservoir. I
noticed a small waterfall on the opposite side of the brook.

As I reached the top of Wessenden Head there was a Canadian couple who were trying to work out which way the Pennine Way
went so I pointed them in the right direction. I was then asked by a lady with a large group of other "Instagrammers"
who had just tumbled out of cars from the nearby road "_Is the waterfall nearby?_" I tried to explain that I had passed
a waterfall but that it was 30-40 minutes down the track behind me and I didn't know which waterfall they were looking
for. They seemed to think I was referring to the road they had just left and not the track behind me. I gave up trying
to answer their question as it seemed futile. Crossing the A635 felt like being on home territory having gone along it a
few times earlier in the year to go climbing at the [Standing Stones][standingstones]. Good paving slabs led over Dean
Clough and up to Black Hill then across open moorland with a _very_ boggy section where the paving slabs had disappeared
to the head of Crowden Great Brook. This involved weaving back and forth across the brook before the path rose up the
hillside to go over [Laddow Rocks][laddow]. Normally I would have a poke around and a small climb but was finding this
section tough going as the heather made for a very narrow path and using poles was fairly pointless. Pretty uneven rocks
down to Crowden, but I soon passed through the garden of [Crowden Outdoor Education Centre][coec] where one of my
friends from the [Peak Climbing Club][pcc] worked. Had it been a weekday I would have stopped to say hello but it was
early evening on a Saturday so he wasn't around.

Checked in at [Crowden campsite][crowdencampsite], the most expensive of the trip at £13, and said hello to Mike who had
just finished pitching his tent and to a father and son who had hiked over from Marsden and had been hoping to wild camp
on Black Hill or above Laddow before continuing to Kinder Scout for the night and then onto Hathersage. They were trying
out their kit in prepertion of hiking part of the [Kungsleden Trail][kungsleden] which I'd never heard of but sounds
interesting, albeit almost twice as long as the Pennine Way, although considerably flatter by the sounds of it.

Mike and I decided to order some takeaways as it was our last night on the trail. I had another pizza with chips and he
had a burger with chips. The food arrived as it got dark and we chatted over dinner before an early night as we were
both tired from the long day and had Bleaklow and Kinder the following day.


### Day 12 - Crowden to Edale

28km to cover before 15:00, my self-imposed finish time to ensure I can claim to have completed The Way in 12 days so up
early. Unconventionally for me I had one of my remaining two meals for breakfast, pasta and mushrooms, to see me through
as there are no shops or pubs between Crowden and Edale. I packed the tent up damp from the previous nights rain, not
caring as I was heading home today and could dry it once there. I said goodbye to Mike who was in no rush after the
previous days efforts and thanked him for his company the previous day. Wished the father and son pair good luck on
their the rest of their trip over-nighting on Kinder and then heading to Hathersage and their planned Arctic trip.

Clear blue skies and warm sun helped me set a decent pace as I headed down to the dam of Torside Researvoir and crossed
over to the steep climb up onto the Bleaklow plateau. Half-way up the steep section whilst snapping pictures with the
Sony for some bizarre reason it stopped taking pictures, it would focus and do everything except actually take and save
the picture. I wasted about 15-20 minutes trying to sort it before deciding it would have to wait and besides I had a
12-month warranty on it courtesy of Harrison Cameras excellent second-hand policy, so continued up the remaining section
of the trail that runs round the edge of Torside Clough. As I crossed over the clough at the top I had another go at
fixing the camera and resetting all settings seemed to sort it out. Will have to keep an eye on this though and consider
returning it if the problem recurs.

Bleaklow Head was easy to find, but the wind had picked up a bit and it was starting to feel chilly when exposed. I had
forgotten what a pain it was navigating through the groughs on Bleaklow, compounded by the fact it had rained recently
and/or overnight so many had running water in them and navigating round them slowed me down a bit, but soon the number
of people I was passing, most going to look at the remains of the plane crash, increased and I soon reached the head of
the Alport River. Having walked from here to Kinder a few weeks previously when training I knew exactly where to go. Not
that its hard, a massive path and paving slabs lead you to the crossing of the A57. A few kilometres of paving slab
followed before swinging south and heading up the North tip of Kinder Scout. It was pretty windy on the edge of the
plateau but there were plenty of people about, presumably going to see the inverted waterfall phenomenon which occurs
when the wind is high as the water falling off of [Kinder Downfall][kinderdownfall] gets blown back up in an endless
cycle, although being the end of summer it wasn't as impressive as it can be in autumn.

Grateful of the poles I traversed the edge of the plateau passing behind the Upfall and heading South towards Edale
Rocks and Jacobs Ladder. Lots of people were out on the hills which is great to see but something of a shock given how
quiet it had been along most of The Way. I had my eye on the clock to make sure I got to Edale before 15:00 so didn't
hang around and apart from offering a bit of advice to people who looked lost and talking to a couple who had been
keeping pace and talking loudly about how to stay fit (they were impressed with having walked +400km in 12 days) I kept
moving and got to Barber Booth. I'd forgotten The Way has one very small bit of uphill to return to Edale here but it
passed quickly and I was soon bouncing down through the last field to take the track that goes along a small brook into
Edale. With no fanfare I exited the path and was done, I had reached [The Nags Head][nagshead], the time was 14:51 so I
had walked there from [Kirk Yetholm][ky] in pretty much 12 days of hiking and was delighted, if a little tired.

Three members of [Edale Mountain Rescue][emr] were out collecting donations to fund their excellent work so I approached
them and asked if one of them would mind snapping a couple of pictures of me. "_Only because you've got a Podsacs
rucksack_" said one of them. My riposte was simple "_Does hiking the Pennine Way in 12 days qualify for a
picture?_". The gentleman was more than happy to oblige me and suggested we go over to the wall where there was a plaque
as well as snapping pictures next to the pub. I ducked inside to grab a pint and asked if there was a log book to sign
which there was, much smaller than the one at [Kirk Yetholm][ky] but I recorded my walk and took my pint (and a pint of
water) outside to chat to the guys from Mountain Rescue and check train times.

![[They got the sign wrong](https://flic.kr/p/2qgcohx)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53993223615_db168c1299_3k.jpg)


Hydrated I wandered down to the train station to catch the 15:33 train which was typically delayed and did some
stretching of my tired legs and was rudely reminded of why I enjoy being in quiet places because some drunk idiot
started making fun of me for doing "yoga". Train arrived late and whisked me back to Sheffield and I was grateful of the
free ride as no ticket inspector passed through the carriage I was in. My wife and daughter were out so I walked home,
not that I'd have accepted a lift anyway, stopping for a pint in a local pub ([The Brothers Arms][brothersarms]) before
heading home.

Having been away for 12 days there were tons of leaves on our drive and in the street so before heading in I put my pack
down and grabbed my broom and set about clearing them. After five minutes or so the front door opened and my wife and
daughter asked if I was going to actually come in. I felt bad when I did as my daughter had made a lovely finishing
banner for me to break through with "_Welcome Home Daddy_" in rainbow letters. She had apparently been peeking out the
window keeping an eye out for me.

## Reflections

The Pennine Way passes through a lot of rugged, remote and beautiful countryside and I would highly recommend hiking it
in some manner at some point in your life.

- Hiking multiple days is _really_ good fun.
- Comfortable shoes are essential.
- Sandals and shorts are great for wet weather and bogs. I used a pair of [Teva's][tevaterra] and have bought another
  spare pair.
- Grass is the best thing for walking on, rubble the worst.
- There are lots of really nice friendly people in the countryside. Get out of the town or city you live in and go and
  meet them and take the spirit back to the city. Rather than keeping your head down say hello to the people you pass.
- [Backpacking-induced Paresthesias][paraestheias] (see also [here][numbtoes]) is weird and lasted for at least three
  weeks.
- Rain isn't that bad really, but combined with wind can be somewhat tiring.
- Head winds are annoying.
- Walking poles are amazing for reducing stress on your knees and allowing you to go faster for longer.
- You don't have to go a long way to meet your neighbours.
