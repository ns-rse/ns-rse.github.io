This summer I decided to hike the iconic [Pennine Way][pw] a 431 kilometre (261 miles) national trail stretching between
[Kirk Yetholm][ky] in the North and [Edale][edale] in the South. Traditionally the route is hiked from South to North
but as I live in Sheffield and have hiked around Kinder, Bleaklow and Blackhill I decided to hike from North to South as
even if I didn't complete the route I would get to see places I wasn't familiar with and it was also cheaper to buy an
advance rail ticket than have to purchase one on the day of return as I had no idea how long it would take.

## Planning

A number of years ago I attempted to hike the Pennine Way from Edale and having set off from Edale and reached Crowden
in good time decided I could combine the first two days and continued to Standedge. This was a mistake as I wasn't used
to hiking with such weight and its a rough section up over Laddow Rocks. Half way there my knee didn't like this and I
hobbled the rest of the way and called my wife to come and collect me, heading home with my tail between my legs.

I didn't want to repeat this but I had no idea how long this would take me so booked two and a half weeks off of work
allowing me 18 days to complete. I use [OpenStreetMap][osm] and the excellent [BRouter WebUI][brouter] to plan days of
upto 35km hiking although one day came in at 44km which I was wary of as I typically don't enjoy hiking more than 30km
without carrying significant weight so didn't want to push myself too hard. But I figured I could be flexible and go
slower if needed, and it wouldn't be a problem if I was faster I could just drink more beer!

A kit list of what I took is at the end along with details of what I used and didn't, but I took everything I needed for
camping along with clothes, a stove for boiling water, six dehydrated meals, maps, battery pack and a guide which I
would have to read backwards as it covered the route from South to North over 20 days.

## Tracking

I use [OpenTracks][openttracks] to privately record [GPX][gpx] tracks of my hiking, running and cycling as it stores
them only on the device on which they are recorded, although you can of course copy them elsewhere and use them as you
like. I did this each day I hiked recording almost complete traces for the whole trip. I had one short drop out and
missed restarting after having a meal but after that often left it running whilst stopped for lunch or dinner sto avoid
forgetting to restart.

I uploaded each track to an instance of [FitTrackee][ft] that I host myself which provided a neat way of reviewing the
statistics for each days hiking which I have exported and saved to CSV and used in the tables and figures of this
write-up.

Details and more information about these and other Open Source tools for self-research that protect the users privacy
from the pernicious intrusions made by Big Tech can be found on the [Personal Science Wiki][psw].

## Pictures

I carried my phone, a Motorla GT100 and a Sony RX100 Mk IV with me along the route. I take a _lot_ of pictures, most are
crap but some are half decent and I've included in this post the better ones or those that accompany the story well. You
can find the full set of pictures on my [Pennine Way Flickr album][flickr_pw].

## Day by Day

### Day 1 - Sheffield to Kirk Yetholm

Having packed over the previous few days I weighed the rucksack with 2 litres of water attached, 17.4kg.

This was a walking holiday so I waved goodbye to my wife and daughter around 07:30 feeling fresh and walked to the train
station to catch the 08:22 train to Berwick-Upon-Tweed. Being Sheffield this involved a hill and it wasn't too bad
carrying the extra weight of the rucksack.

The train journey was uneventful, but gave me time to sit and read a book on the Kobo I bought with me. I had bought the
Kobo for hiking in the Julian Alps of Slovenia the previous year as I didn't want to carry multiple books. Having
recently started reading Johann Harri's [_Stolen Focus : Why You Can't Pay Attention_][stolenfocus] I expected to get through it
and had some fiction to read as well (Haruki Murakami's [_IQ84_][iq84]). The countryside passed by as did the first couple
of chapters and before long I was getting off at Berwick-Upon-Tweed.

I'd checked the schedule and had a short wait before the bus to Kelso arrived. There was a gentleman trying to
straighten one of two buckled wheels on his bike outside the station. Its quite hard to buckle wheels and I figured he'd
therefore been in an accident recently so went and asked if he was ok. He said he was but that he'd been knocked off by
a car turning across him. He was lucky and only had a few bruises but his bike was not ride-able and he was supposed to
be cycling to Wales. He asked me to stand on one side of the wheel whilst he stood on the other to try and straighten
it. Unsurprisingly this didn't work. He then noticed some fence railings and tried levering it
straight...unsuccessfully. Not only were both his wheels buckled but the built-in pannier rack that was part of the
frame had sheered off so he would have trouble carrying his bags. He wasn't hurt so I left him to his own devices and
explored Castle Vale Park which led down to the River Tweed by the Royal Border Bridge and the remains of Berwick
Castle.

![[Royal Border Bridge, Berwick Upon Tweed | Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957436114/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957436114_f54e2d4177_k.jpg)

A nice way to kill some time but I didn't want to miss my bus so headed back through Castle Vale Park to wait at
the bus stop. It arrived and set-off on time and I bounced through some nice farmland towards Kelso, spying The Cheviot
hills in the distance which I would be hiking up in a few hours.

Didn't have masses of time to explore Kelso but grabbed a baguette and had a pint around the town square and purchased a
bottle of [Traquair Jacobite Ale (8% ABV)](https://www.traquair.co.uk/product/traquair-jacobite-ale/) to drink before
bed (with limited weight I wanted something strong!).

Another bus journey and I arrived in Kirk Yetholm. I'd clocked someone who looked like they were hiking and as we got of
asked where he was heading. He said he was supposed to have been doing an Ultrar-marathon through the area but had
injured himself a few days before the start so was taking active recovery by walking and bussing his way along the
route. He kindly offered to snap a picture of me next to the Pennine Way map on the bus-stop, bid me farewell and headed
off whilst I went for another pint in [The Border][border], the pub that marks the "end" (or start) of the Pennine Way.

![[The Border Inn |

Had a nice chat with a local who had lived in Sheffield in the past and was joined by what seemed the proprietor of the
pub who said me I should sign the log-book behind the bar even though I was leaving. I duly did so to log the start date
somewhere and considered purchasing a t-shirt but a) it was in the wrong direction and b) I hadn't even started, let
alone finished hiking at that point. One of them kindly offered to snap a picture of me in front of the pub's display of
the end of The Way.

### Day 1 - 2024-08-14 Kirk Yetholm to Clennell Street


Beer drunk I said farewell, shouldered my pack and started the GPS tracker, setting off up the lane in the heat of the
afternoon. Not ideal conditions for hiking but I had a schedule to follow.

![[Above Kirk Yetholm | Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957116986/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957116986_2f287b5fb9_k.jpg)

![[Follow The Path | Pretty good advice for route finding most of the way |
Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957365433/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957365433_2875252fee_k.jpg)

There are two options to this section of The
Way, a high option going over various hills and low option for when weather is foul. I didn't have that excuse and had
been planning on stopping for the night at the [Auchope Refuge Hut][auchope] which was on the high route so up the hills
I went. These undulated but the path was good and I made good time arriving at the hut in around three hours.

![[Auchope Refuge |
Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/slackline/53957365283/in/datetaken/)](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53957365283_8955e170d8_k.jpg)

With a few more hours of daylight left I decided to push on and find somewhere else to wild camp as my legs weren't
tired and I had plenty of time, even though this involved a steep climb from Auchope Rigg up most of Cairn Hill. I
decided in doing so not to do the dog-leg extension of The Way across the flat-ish moor to the summit of The Cheviot,
the hill after which the area is named as it added an extra 4km to the journey and would have taken about an hour and I
was now on the lookout for somewhere to stop.

Heading downhill there weren't many options forthcoming, lots of heather with a path through it but as things levelled
out I came to a cross-roads with a path marked Clennell Street with a sign indicating that motor vehicles were not
allowed between 1st April and 1st May. Quite how anything but motorbikes could get up there I've no idea, but there was
a flat patch of grass so I donned a long-sleeve top to keep the midges away and setup the tent and bed for the
night. That done I had my dinner of some ciabatta and pate along with the bottle of Traquair Jacobite I'd carried along
and as the sunset I snuggled down for the first night under canvas feeling pleased to have gone a little further than
planned and had no problems hiking up the hills with the weight of my pack.

![[Clennell Street |

### Day 2 - Clennell Street to Bryness

Woke early around 05:00 as the tent was flapping in the wind and it was raining earlier than forecast. After listening
to the rain for a while I got up at 05:30 and after eating some more pate and bread donned my waterproof jacket, shorts
and sandals, packed the tent up and set off in the clouds for Windy Gyle which lived up to its name. There is a large
pile of stones on the summit which is an ancient monument which should not be distubed, not much to look at because of
the low cloud so I continued the descent, which roughly follows the bordere between Scotland and England, glad of my
choice of sandals and shorts because it was very boggy in places. I came across [Yearning Saddle Refuge Hut][yearning]
and took the opportunity to get out of the wind and rain and eat one of the blueberry snack bars I'd carried. A few
pieces of food had been left for people who might need them along with lots of reminders to take your rubbish with you,
which I had already done bringing my empty beer bottle with me.

Navigation was straight-forward as the trail was well marked with regular way markers and sign-posts although there was
a split with an "alternative" route sign-posted. I opted to stick with the original which followed a "permissive
by-way". Passed a couple of herds of feral goats and met a guy heading north who was on day 46 of hiking from Lands End
to John O'Groats which was pretty impressive. He said that he'd broken a walking pole yesterday and would have to make a
detour to replace it which reminded me that in The Border the previous day I had seen a rack for "_Free walking poles_"
with a single pair hanging so I suggested he could grab try grabbing them from there since the [Scotish National
Trail][snt], Scotlands equivalent of the Pennine Way, starts at The Border and I figured he'd be passing
through. Unfortunately his planned route didn't follow The Way to Kirk Yetholm but he was hopeful he'd be able to pick
another pole up somewhere else.

As I got nearer Bryness I started to see more people, there was one guy off to have a meal in one of the mountain
refuges. He had a long beard which made me wonder whether this was a good insulator against the rain or whether it
helped water ingress into the jacket, not something I'd ever consider with regards to water-proofing. A family group of
four heading north were next and then a couple who were finishing off their journey along The Way having left Edale 16
days previously. They were very friendly and reeled off many of the highlights I would pass, warning that it would
likely be windy on Cross Fell.

I arrived at the [Forest View Inn][fvi] where I had booked to camp for the night around 13:00 having covered the ~25 km
in around six hours but they didn't open for check-in until 16:00. Fortuantely the conservatory was accsessible and
South facing so I was able to warm up and start drying my soaked clothes. My pack had remained dry thanks to the Deuter
rain cover my wife had got me as a birthday present. I was both surprised and pleased with this as previous rain covers
I have had were not very effective at all.

Just before 16:00 a cat appeared at the back door to the conservatory and shortly after Oli appeared and checked me in
(i.e. took my food order for the evening, I opted for Tortellini Pasta bake). Oli and Laura were a lovely welcoming
couple who took over the [Forest View Inn][fvi] bed and breakfast, formerly a Youth Hostel, around four years ago having
got fed up with desk jobs in Manchester. Oli had previously lived in Sheffield on Eccellsal Road and done some climbing
in his time, but was more of a runner these days. He'd attempted both the North and Southern [Spine Race][spinerace]
Challenger twice and completed each once.

I took the first of several beers that evening and pitched my tent in the back garden, spreading my wet things out over
a picnic bench to dry in the sun, ignoring the fact there was a drying room which is great but fresh air is much more
preferable.

Other guests started to arrive, first was a couple of ladies who were reconnaissancing The Way from Alston to Kirk
Yetholm as one of them, Nicola, would be attempting the Winter [Spine Race][spinerace] for the second time in January
2025 having had to drop out (literally) when she collapsed outside of Alston due to infections in her feet where the
skin had all detached due to a poor choice of overly tight waterproof socks. Her friend Rachel was no slouch on the
racing front either as they had got to know each other whilst running the [Dragons Back][dragonsback] race which
traverses the length of Wales taking in all the 3000 ft peaks. Rachel had not only completed the race, most drop out at
some stage, but had done so after falling on the first day and fracturing her wrist and a rib. Tough and crazy women!

Oli had popped out to retrieve some guests who had stayed the previous night and were doing the remaining section of The
Way over two days, returning to [Forest View Inn][fvi] in-between and returning to finish off the trek to Kirk Yetholm
the following day. This included the family I'd met and a couple I'd passed and a guy from Sheffield who was on his own
and finishing off the trail having started in Edale.

Dinner was communal and very sociable and revolved heavily around the ludicrious experiences Nicola and Rachel had
running ultra-marathons. I had another beer after dinner but headed to bed early around 21:00 shortly after the sun had
set but not before picking up a vegetable pasty and paying for my beer and food.


### Day 3 - Bryness to Hadrians Wall

Slept well but woke early again around 05:00 despite there not being any wind or rain. I didn't hang about too long,
took another shower and was packed and off by 06:50. Ducked into [St Francis' Church][stfrancis] and chatted to a guy
who had spent the night in there. He was hiking around [Kielder Forest][kielder] stopping wherever he fancied. Wishing
him a good time I got back on track and The Way then followed good solid forestry trails through pine forests for about
15-16km before breaking out onto moorland which I reached in about three hours. The moorland wasn't too bad, mainly as
it was mostly paved so the few boggy bits weren't a problem. I stepped over what I thought were some carnivourous plants
but was in too much of a hurry to go back and photograph them to check which I regret now as I didn't see any more.

Didn't pass many people until I was near Bellingham, this was to become something of a theme due to my early starts, but
met a few people heading North along The Way. One guy complemented me on how fast I had been coming down the hill (the
angle helped!) and a very jolly Welsh lady wanted to snap a picture with me to add to her collection she was posting to
Farcebook. There was another solo hiker who had come all the way from Edale who looked fit and happy.

I reached Bellingham around 13:30 having covered 26km in just over five hours and opted for pizza and beer at [The
Cheviot Hotel][cheviothotel] which was delicious and grabbed some beers for later in the day before setting off on The
Way again. I felt good and noticed I had a voice in my head telling me to "_engage the core powerhouse_", "_activate the
glutes when stepping forward_" and "_keep the shoulders back and stomach in_" which was Sam Webster, my [pilates
instructor][symmetrypilates] common mantra during the classes I attend. This seemed like good advice as slouching and
lolloping forward would only end in injury so I resolved to make sure I was walking up-right and fully engaging my body
whilst walking for the rest of the hike. Listening to music for the first time since starting hiking I realised this
also helped with the rhythm of walking as did focusing on my breathing (related to actively engaging core and body).

The hiking from Bellingham was fairly mundane, crossing agricultural land before entering another managed forest and
following good tracks through these. Around 17:00 I started keeping an eye out for somewhere to camp, knowing that I
wouldn't make it to the next town I'd planned to stop at, Greenhead, as it was too far away. After leaving the forest
The Way crossed some moorland and in a shallow valley and in the middle was a walled off area with a few trees. This
looked ideal as the walls provided good shelter from the wind which was still hitting me head on from the South, but on
reflection I decided not to stop here because if the wind dropped it would have been midge hell so I continued until I
reached [Cragend by Greenlee Moss][cragend] which gave a brilliant view across the lake as the sun was setting. There
was a convenient stone wall which provided shelter from the wind and after clearing some cow and sheep shit out of the
way I set myself up for the night and set about rehydrating one of the meals I had with me.

I'd not really given it much thought as they were [small/far away][fatherted] but the fact I'd had to clear the area of
cow shit to pitch my tent should have rung a bell in my head. It hadn't, but the loud snort of an approaching bell did
so I grabbed my pouch of rehydrating food and put the wall between the bull and myself. It had wandered up with a couple
of calves who started sniffing around my stove which I'd left out and I gently shooed them away from the safety of the
wall. Fortunately the bull was taking more of an interest in a female the other side of the fence. After a stand-off of
about five minutes they all lost interest in me (or perhaps the lack of food which I'd eaten) and wandered off which was
my opportunity to quickly take the tent down and move onto a safer spot, recalling the devestation cows had wrecked on
some neighbours tents whilst I was in Peru 2012.

It was starting to get dark as I headed over to [Rapishaw Gap][rapishaw] on Hadrians Wall and heading towards Milking
gap I started scoping for a flat place to pitch my tent, regretting not going up the other side of Rapishaw Gap where
there looked like a nice sheltered spot, but I didn't have to go far until I found a spot and re-pitched my tent. As I
was finishing off I was startled by a guy passing by who said it looked like a nice spot to camp. He'd been out running
but had lost track of time watching the sunset but didn't have too far to go to get back.

I was tired after around 50 km of hiking so crawled into the tent and fell asleep quickly.

### Day 4 - Hadrians Wall to Garigill

Woke early and stuck my head out of the tent to a beautiful sunrise along the line of the wall. Didn't hang around too
long, collapsed the tent and packed everything away fairly quickly to avoid getting in trouble for camping on (next to)
an ancient monument. I don't eat breakfast so off we went on the undulations of Hadrians Wall. Quickly reached the
famous [Sycamore Gap][sycamoregap] passing a couple of climbers who were also camping/bivvying on the wall to make the
walk-in to the crag extremely short.

Being up and walking early is lovely, its quiet and there aren't many people about so it was nice avoiding whatever
crowds were to arrive later in the day. There were a few like minded people about, one lady commenting the exact same
thing, another walking from Cawfields to Sycamore Gap who had waved from across a gap. The countryside is really quite a
friendly place, especially for those out on their own.

[Toilets][cawfields] at Cawfields Lake were very welcome and there was also fresh water available which was useful for
the coming day. Hadrians Wall petters out here and crosses some farmland where I met a couple of guys heading North on
The Way and encouraged them onwards as they didn't have too far to go compared to how far they come, which reminded me
how much further I still had to go.

Passing through [Walltown Quarry][walltownquarry] which has been beautifully transformed into a small nature reserve I
stopped in the shop and grabbed a can of Sprite to drink to keep my energy up as I had decided not to detour into
Greenhead in search of food (this turned out to be a mistake) and instead carried on passing [Thirlwall
Castle][thirlwallcastle], although as I had a long way to go I only snapped a picture from outside and didn't explore
the grounds. As you cross the railway line shortly after [Thirlwall View][thirlwallview] had a little honesty tuck shop
for hikers of The Way to re-supply. I didn't have any change so only took pictures rather than some food. Such tuck
shops were to crop up a number of times along The Way and it was lovely to see how generous and helpful people could be
towards strangers.

I survived a game of [Frogger][frogger] on the A69 but was mildly alarmed by the sign on the gate which warned of
biological hazards, although they only seemed to apply to those who undertaking work on telephone masts! The next few
kilometers were fairly mundane going gently uphill through grazed fields and low lying moorland. After a couple of hours
though and not having had any food I was starting to get tired, my feet were hurting and my pace slowed. It became hard
work going up hill and for the first time in four days I wasn't really enjoying myself. I hoped there would be somewhere
to get a snack in Slaggyford but alas not but as I was planning to get to Garigill for the night and had to pass through
Alston so figured I'd be able to eat on the way through. Looking at the map I decided that I wasn't going to do what
appeared to be a fairly mundane loop out across a hillside and instead head along the road into Alston.

Just after leaving the road the smell of chips frying wafted up the road from [The Nook][thenook] and I knew instantly
where I would be eating. They had burger night on so I ordered a delicious chicken burger which came with a healthy
portion of chipps and quaffed a couple of cans of lemon Fanta. Feeling tired I asked staff if there was anywhere to camp
in Alston, they didn't think so but asked another customer who was local who confirmed this but advised to "_just camp
on the village green, no one will care and lots of people do it_". I thanked the staff and locals for advice and taking
their advice shouldered the pack and crossed the adjacent field to reach a track that ran along the [South Tynedale
Railway][tynedalerailway] which was a nice compact and flat trail into Alston and took me from Northumberland into
Cumberland.

Feelin invigorated by the food I stopped in the Alston House Hotel for a pint and after grabbing some supplies
(viz. beer, sweets and lunch for the next day) set off up hill to my original target for the day, Garigill. I'd read
about a diversion because the [Dryburn Bridge was closed due to flood damage][dryburn] which took me a long an
alternative trail on the north side of the river which didn't look as though it had seen much traffic and involved
hacking through shoulder height ferns in the fading light.

As I entered Garigill I met a lady out walking her dog who asked if I was intending on camping behind the village hall
which I was. She advised me I might want to look elsewhere as there was a wedding reception in the hall that evening and
suggested a spot down by the river which would be quieter. Again I was surprised at how welcoming and helpful people
were to those trekking The Way and thanked her for her advice. I was too tired to go looking for alternatives though so
when I got to the village hall spoke to a couple of guys outside having cigarettes saying I had been hoping to camp out
the back that evening. They said I should just go through and pitch up and that I could even join the party and have
some curry which was very generous but I was satiated and tired and just wanted to go to bed so I went through and
pitched my tent in the far corner under a tree, had a beer and showed some curious children from the wedding what my
tent was like then went to bed. A short while later I was woken though as some of the kids decided to use my tent as a
target for throwing plastic bottles and cans at. I didn't bother rising to the bate and stayed quiet in my tent. The
music stopped around 23:00 and I heard some arguing (alcohol and families often result in high emotions) but at least
the shower of plastic bottles and cans had stopped and I soon drifted off to sleep.

### Day 5 - Garigill to High Cup Nick

Slept until about 06:30 as I had a relatively short day planned going up and over Cross Fell, down into Dufton and on to
[High Cup Nick][highcupnick]. I collected the rubbish that had been thrown at my tent and put it in the recycling and
chatted to a lady who was tidying up after last nights reception. Turns out it was the bride who hadn't been able to
sleep knowing that she had to tidy up so she'd got up early to get started with the job.

I had a shower, after clearing up what broken glass from the night before that I could see on the floor and managed to
avoid cutting my feet which would have been bad for hiking. Dropped some cash in the honesty box (aka letter box) packed
up and set off heading up Cross Fell. The path was a good compact track, no doubt for the grouse shooting that went on
up on the moor.

After winding my way up the hill side the beautiful [Gregs Hut][gregshut] came into view and I poked my head in to have
a look around before continuing. Will definitely have to come back and spend at least one night here in the future.

A short steep section led to the plateau of Cross Fell with its excellent stone shelter from the wind and another trig
point. There was a party of three with a couple of dogs who had hiked up from Dufton for the day when I arrived and we
chatted briefly. I had a beer before snapping a panorama and heading off and over Great Dun Fell with its listening
station on the summit like a golf ball poised to be driven south over the A66. The path then headed down into Dufton
where I had been planning on eating at the [The Stag Inn][staginn]. Arriving just after 16:00 I had to wait
until 17:00 until food was served and was told I couldn't look at the menu in advance as there was a party of eight
booked in and they were taking priority so I would have to order after them. In the end the party (two families) turned
up late and by 17:15 hadn't decided what they wanted to eat so I was allowed to order ahead of them (as had a number of
other people who were eating but hadn't been waiting as long as I had). Not the friendliest of service I came across but
the food was ok.

It was getting late and in my rush to set off and get to [High Cup Nick][highcupnick] I set off without my walking
poles. I didn't get far before realising this so dashed back to the pub to grab them and set off at a decent pace to
climb back up the hill, passing a pair who had walked from Middleton in Teesdale that day heading North along The
Way. The 6km and ~300m of ascent (most of which are in the first 2-3km) were accomplished quickly (just over an hour)
and I found myself coming onto the rim of the amazing [High Cup Nick][highcupnick], a valley with a dolerite rim with
limestone above and below the layer of dolerite. As I neared the head I kept my eyes open for a flat spot to camp, not
wanting to pitch up at the very top where it was boggier and there would be more midges if the wind dropped (needn't
have worried, the wind barely stopped the whole trip!).

I snapped a few pictures in the fading light then setup my tent for the night and went to sleep almost instantly.

### Day 6 - High Cup Nick to Middleton in Teesdale

Wet, misty and windy this morning, I'd made the right decision heading up the previous night to see [High Cup
Nick][highcupnick] in all its glory as I couldn't see much of it this morning. Packed the tent up and was off quickly,
looking forward to a short day of 28km almost exclusively downhill along the edge of the Maize Beck then the River Tees
to Middleton in Teeside.

Crossed a bridge that had been erected in memory of Ken Wilson and followed a good compact
track downhill passing through [Birksdale Farm][birksdale] and shortly after coming on to the fantastic view of the
confluence of Maize Beack and River Tees. The trail swings by underneath the dam of [Cow Green Reservoir][cowgreen] and
down the side of [Cauldron Snout][caulrdonsnout] which was in full flow and very impressive.

The Way then follows the River Tees all the way to Middleton on Tees side. Heading down this section I met a lady
heading North along The Way, the first solo female hiker I'd met. She had set off early and was keen to reach Dufton
before the forecast rain passed through, just as I was keen to reach Middleton.

After passing through [Cronkley farm][cronkley] I came across what seemed like a Juniper forest with lots of small stout
evergreens that looked to me like Juniper, something I've encountered on cliff faces over the years climbing but never
seen a forest of. [Force Garth Quarry][garthquarry] was passed and very soon I arrived above [High Force
Waterfall][highforce] which was quite spectacular. Snapped a few shots from above then went round to the viewing area
from the South to get some shots, waiting to get into position as there were a lot of people about, including a
school/youth group.

Plodding along down hill the sound of the water bubbling over waterfalls was too tempting and I opted to cool my feet
off in the cold water. It was delightful and I wish I had done it earlier. If you can stand it for long enough it
rejunivates the feet, taking down swelling (the longer you stay in the more swelling goes down) and is just a delightful
contrast to pounding the floor.

[Low Force][lowforce] came very soon after with the [something suspension bridge][] which strongly advised not to have
more than one person on it at any given time which I and others duly respected. A little further along the trail I met a
couple out for a short walk who asked if I was walking the Pennine Way (the big rucksack and poles are a bit of a
giveaway) we chatted and it transpired they were from Sheffield and occasionally drank in [The Brothers
Arms][brothersarms] had just passed a pair who were also hiking from North to South who were also from Sheffield and who
one of them knew. This was a first! I'd almost caught up some other Wayfarers heading South! I said farewell and as my
feet were sore though so I decided to cool them off in the River Tees. Refreshed I resolved to catch up the pair from
Sheffield and a short while later I came across two people with rucksacks who had stopped for a short break. It was the
two Wayfarers who were heading South, I said I was heading the same way too as I lived in Sheffield so it was like
walking home (knowing full well this was likely to be the pair from Sheffield). They were indeed from Sheffield and we
came round to where abouts we lived, I said Meersbrook and one of them asked if I drank in [The Brothers
Arms][brothersarms] which I do and he then asked where I lived. Transpires one of them, Martin who was 70, lives at
number 59 on the same road as me! His friend had walked the Pennine Way many years ago when he was 17 and Martin had
tried a year after lockdown but had aborted so they had joined forces to complete the way again. We posed for a picture
and resolved to catch up when we were both back in Sheffield.

It was only a short distance to [Middleton on Teesdale][middleton] where I noticed [Ozzys Pizza][ozzys] on the way into
town but headed straight to the pub for a couple of mid-afternoon pints in [The Forresters][forresters] and wrote up some
over-due notes in my diary and charged by phone and camera. A guy, Dave, playing darts and pools asked if I needed
somewhere to camp for the night and said it would be fine to pitch up in the yard of his portaloo company. I thanked him
for the offer but politely declined saying I wanted to have a shower, very friendly pub and people. Suitably refreshed I
swung by the Co-Op for some beers and sweets and headed back out of town to [Daleview][daleview] where I met Andy and
Alex who were heading North on The Way. Andy knew lots about The Pennine Way as he volunteered to work on [The Spine
Race][spinerace] and mentioned the Middleton Tandoori which piqued my interest as I love curry. Unfortunately this was
only a transient restaurant that was setup to feed participants and volunteers. Andy proudly told me he'd eaten 12
portions of Chicken Korma one year but seemed put out that this coming year they had moved the station and said that he
would not be able to indulge to quite such an extent. Alex was closer to my age, probably a bit younger and we agreed to
head into town to grab a pizza for dinner that evening from Ozzy's which was delicious (we invited Andy but he passed,
favouring his own food).

Alex was a software engineer with a degree in computer science but was also learning about horticulture, initially to
grow produce but more recently had got interested in ornamental plants. We popped back to The Forresters after pizza for
another pint and to charge devices before heading back to the campsite for the night.

### Day 7 - Middleton in Teesdale to Thwaite

Big day as I was hoping to get to Hawes in one big push stopping for lunch at the [Tan Hill Inn][tanhillinn], England's
highest pub. It was unfortunately drizzling when I woke up early but I forced myself out of the tent and packed it away,
noticing that Andy had the foresight to bring a cloth to wipe his tent down and get most of the moisture off of it

I'd made an organisational error and didn't get snacks (i.e. sweets to chomp on whilst hiking) from the Co-op the previous
night after pizza and beers with Alex so after packing everything up I hiked into town to grab some more Haribo Starmix
before setting off on The Way in light drizzle. Gentle arable land rolled past with a couple of tuck shops passed on the
way, one of which had Irn-Bru cans for sale which I took advantage of for an energy boost later on. [Grassholme
Reservoir][grassholme] was quickly passed. Coming over Beck Head there was a barn owl circling around the field, it
seemed to be struggling to gain height and escape in the strong wind that was blowing as it circled the area multiple
times. I thought I glimpsed someone walking ahead of me in the same direction with a red bag but lost sight of them
quickly even though I should have had a clear view of them as I dropped down into the valley with [Blackton
Reservoir][blackton] as the path went up the hillside opposite. I soon caught up with them though as  they had
stopped for a break just past Clove Lodge. It was a lady called Jolyene from Ireland who was a locum vet in Cornwall who
was doing The Way in sections with her dog (who's name I forget). We fell into step and talked for a while, losing the
path as we headed up Peatbrig Hill. She was looking to redress the balance in her life and spend more time doing the
things she enjoyed, running (when the body allowed), travelling with friends and family and her main passion
surfing. Around Race Yate she stopped to give her dog some water and said she couldn't keep pace.

I carried on dropping down to cross the A66 which was a little weird as its somewhere I drive along when heading to
Keswick. It was quite noisy due to the traffic, a complete contrast to the quiet hills and dales I'd been walking over
the last week and  even the villages I passed through. Just south of the A66 was a small farm and a sign for "[God's
Bridge][godsbridge]" a natural limestone bridge over the River Greta. There wasn't much water flowing but it was very
cool. If I hadn't been in such a rush I might have investigated more, but I still had a long way to go to get to Hawes.

Following the track up from River Greta I met a father and son who were on day six or seven heading North on The Way. We
had a brief chat and they asked how I was getting on in sandals and shorts which I'd opted for that day as it had been
raining when I set off and I knew I had the bog that leads up to Tan Hill to contend with. I was quite happy walking in
sandals and felt they worked well.

The Way then followed a good shooting track for a few kilometers up the slope towards Tan Hill but eventually petered
out. As I left the trail I met two older ladies who were also following The Way North but had taken the sensible option
of having their kit sherpa'd ahead each day so they had the luxury of walking with lighter day sacks. Not a bad idea at
all I thought as I checked how heavy my pack felt. There were a series of good wooden sign-posts with white painted tops
that marked the way through the bog to Tan Hill summit and the highest pub in England. Near the top I saw a couple in
the middle of the moor and bog disagreeing about which way to go as they tried to get back on the path. As I met them it
was clear they weren't british and I advised them to follow the marker posts and ignore the smaller plastic ones which I
think they had mistakenly started following and had taken them off-track as these were markers for grouse feeders.

On arrival at the [Tan Hill Inn][tanhillinn] I popped in to ask if it would be ok to pitch my tent so it could dry in
the wind and sun whilst I had lunch and duly did so before settling down to an expensive pint and scampi and chips which
was good but probably a bit over-priced too in my opinion. No time for a second pint (the queue at the bar precluded
this) so I packed up the now dry tent and set off on a good track towards East Stronsdale, gradually losing
height. Upper [East Gill Force][eastgillforce] was passed and The Way then headed up an interestingly paved path up
Kisdon hill before skirting around over jumbled limestone blocks. At this point a heavy shower passed over and as it was
late in the day I had the delight of a rainbow over Black Hill. Dropping down into [Thwaite][thwaite] there were more
black clouds looming over Dam Hill and Great Shunner Fell so I decided to not push on to Hawes that evening and instead
stop in the campsite I'd seen in the valley. Not before having a beer though so I popped into an empty [Kearton
House][keartonhouse] only to be told that they weren't open and the only reason the door was unlocked was because the
solicitors had just visited.  I was advsed I might be able to get a beer at Usha Campsite where I was heading as they
had a small shop so I walked the kilometre or so down the road only to find I was too late in the day as the shop, and
recenption in general, had closed an hour and a half earlier.

Pitched the tent in a field in the lee of a wall and large tree after carefully looking for dead branches that might
come down in high wind and deciding it was relatively unlikely to happen. A quick shower then boiled some water to make
dinner. There were a number of Duke of Edinbrough participants who were hiking around the area and I chatted to a few
of the as I ate my rehydrated meal in the warmth and comfort of the facilities. They were bemoaning having to hike 20km
or so, but to be fair they were having to carry all of their food, unlike mysel who was making good use of all of the
eateries I was passing.

Pretty tired so had an early night, but not before a few more showers passed through which helped me feel vindicated in
my decision not to push on to Hawes that evening.

### Day 9 - Horton in Ribblesdale to Gargrave

Still raining when I was woken early by Daniil's alarm. Knowing he'd set it early I didn't bother to look at the time
and dozed instead listening to it going off repeatedly. When I finally looked at the time it was 06:50 so I got up and
let Daniil know that he'd missed his early start. He wasn't too bothered, saying that if the body needs rest it needs
rest. We both slowly packed up our kit which was still slightly damp and he sensibly did some stretching before posing
for a picture. We wished each other good luck and he and jumped on his bike and set off, rejoining the Pennine Bridleway
heading ultimately to Cape Wrath.

### Day 12 - Crowden to Edale

28km to cover before 15:00, my self-imposed finish time to ensure I can claim to have completed The Way in 12 days so up
early. Unconventionally for me I had one of my remaining two meals for breakfast, pasta and mushrooms, to see me through
as there are no shops or pubs between Crowden and Edale. I packed the tent up damp from the previous nights rain, not
caring as I was heading home today and could dry it once there. I said goodbye to Mike who was in no rush after the
previous days efforts and thanked him for his company the previous day. Wished the father and son pair good luck on
their the rest of their trip over-nighting on Kinder and then heading to Hathersage and their planned Arctic trip.

Clear blue skies and warm sun helped me set a decent pace as I headed down to the dam of Torside Researvoir and crossed
over to the steep climb up onto the Bleaklow plateau. Half-way up the steep section whilst snapping pictures with the
Sony for some bizarre reason it stopped taking pictures, it would focus and do everything except actually take and save
the picture. I wasted about 15-20 minutes trying to sort it before deciding it would have to wait and besides I had a
12-month warranty on it courtesy of Harrison Cameras excellent second-hand policy, so continued up the remaining section
of the trail that runs round the edge of Torside Clough. As I crossed over the clough at the top I had another go at
fixing the camera and resetting all settings seemed to sort it out. Will have to keep an eye on this though and consider
returning it if the problem recurs.

Bleaklow Head was easy to find, but the wind had picked up a bit by now.

## Reflections

I appear to still have sore feet a week after completing the The Way, a bit of research suggests I may have
[Backpacking-induced Paresthesias][paraestheias] (see also [here][numbtoes]).

- Hiking multiple days is _really_ good fun.
- Comfortable shoes are essential.
- Sandals and shorts are great for wet weather and bogs. I used a pair of [Teva's][tevaterra] but may consider some
  [Bedrock Sandals][bedrock] in the future.
- Grass is the best thing for walking on, rubble the worst.
