This blog is published using the excellent [Quarto][quarto] framework to [GitHub Pages][ghpages] which offers free
website hosting. However, astute readers familiar with this sort of setup will have noticed that the domain is no the
usual `[github-user].github.io` and instead it resolves to `blog.nshephard.dev`. This post explains how to achieve that
as it took me a little bit of work to sort out properly.

## Why?

I found that despite setting a custom domain in the GitHub pages Settings (_Settings > Pages > Custom domain_) each time
I published the site (e.g. on a new blog post) the `CNAME` file disappeared from the `gh-pages` branch and the domain
didn't resolve. I searched but couldn't find a solution to this so raised an
[issue](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/issues/118) to include it in the `quarto-actions`.

In the meantime I added a custom step to the `publish.yaml` to add the `CNAME` file to the `gh-pages` branch after
`Render and Publish` which worked, but I was subsequently pointed to a cleaner existing way of achieving the same
result.

## What isn't covered

This post doesn't cover...

- How to setup a blog/website using Quarto.
- How to write Quarto Markdown.
- How to publish a blog or website using Quarto, they have [excellent documentation][quarto-publish]
- Setting a `CNAME` with your DNS registrar.

On this last point, how you set your `CNAME` to redirect your custom domain to that of the GitHub Pages is dependent on
the domain registrar service you use. I use [OVH][ovh].

## What is covered

- How to add a `CNAME` file to the `gh-pages` branch that is produced by the [`quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish` GitHub
  Action][quarto-publish] so that the pages resolve to a custom domain.

## The Problem

If you use plain [GitHub Pages][ghpages] then you can set a custom `CNAME` by going to _Settings > Pages > Custom
Domain_ and entering the address there. However, as [documented][custom-cname] (see item 4) this doesn't work if you use
a custom GitHub Action to publish your website, which is the case when you use the [`quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish`
GitHub Action][quarto-publish] to publish using Quarto.

Why? Because each time the action runs it regenerates the content of the `gh-pages` branch on the runner and pushes it
to your repository and _doesn't_ include a custom `CNAME` file.

## Solution 1

The solution I initially hit upon was to add an extra step to my `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` that...

1. Checks out the `gh-pages` branch.
2. Creates the `CNAME` file with the domain I use.
3. Adds this to the `gh-pages` branch.
4. Pushes back up-stream.

You should already have added a [publish action][publish-action] to your repository which runs the
[`quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish` GitHub Action][quarto-publish]. This runs `quarto publish $TARGET` where `$TARGET`
is set by the chosen output configured in the `target` argument. In this example `gh-pages`

```yaml
      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

After this you should add the following, substituting `blog.nshephard.dev` for your own domain.

```yaml
      - name: Add CNAME file to gh-pages branch
        run: |
          rm renv/activate.R
          git switch gh-pages
          git pull
          echo 'blog.nshephard.dev > CNAME
          git add CNAME
          git commit -m "Adding CNAME"
          git push
```

This...

1. Removes the lingering `renv/activate.R` which prevents switching branches.
2. Switches branches to `gh-pages`.
3. `git pull` to get the just published version of the branch.
4. Creates the `CNAME` file with the domain you specify.
5. Adds (stages) the `CNAME` file to the `gh-pages` branch.
6. Commits the change.
7. Pushes the commit to `origin` (i.e. the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub)

This worked as the `CNAME` file is added each time the workflow runs but, unsurprisingly, there is a simpler solution.

## Solution 2 - The correct way of doing this

Turns out the [answer](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/issues/118#issuecomment-2445375569) provided by
`@cscheid` is, unsurprisingly, much simpler.

You need to add `CNAME` in the `_quarto.yaml` so that it is included in the project.

``` yaml
project:
  type: website
  resources:
    ...
    - "CNAME"
```

You _also_ have to create and add the `CNAME` file with your domain to the repository.

``` bash
echo 'blog.nshephard.dev` > CNAME
git add CNAME _quarto.yaml
git commit -m "Adding CNAME to repository"
git push
```

Then, because it's included in the resources, the file will carry through/persist when the publishing action runs to
create the `gh-pages` branch with each new update and run on GitHub Actions :magic:.

This feature was introduced in [Quarto 1.2](https://quarto.org/docs/download/changelog/1.2/index.html#publishing) and
others have encountered [problems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79172839/quarto-publish-resets-cname) with the
file being deleted on first running `quarto publish gh-pages` (if you're having problems perhaps worth keeping an eye on
that thread).

There is a [draft Pull Request](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/pull/1091/files) to add it to the
documentation its not been merged which is perhaps why I couldn't find how to do this in the documentation (see also
discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/4941)).
