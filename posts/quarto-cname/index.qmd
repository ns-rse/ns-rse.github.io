This blog is published using the excellent [Quarto][quarto] framework to [GitHub Pages][ghpages] which offers free
website hosting. However, astute readers familiar with this sort of setup will have noticed that the domain is no the
usual `[github-user].github.io` and instead it resolves to `blog.nshephard.dev`. This post explains how to achieve that
as it took me a little bit of work to sort out properly.

## What isn't covered

This post doesn't cover...

- How to setup a blog/website using Quarto.
- How to write Quarto Markdown and include
- How to publish a blog or website using Quarto, they have [excellent documentation][quarto-publish]
- Setting a `CNAME` with your DNS registrar.

How you set your `CNAME` to redirect your custom domain to that of the GitHub Pages is dependent on the domain registrar
service you use. I use [OVH][ovh]

## What is covered

- How to add a `CNAME` file to the `gh-pages` branch that is produced by the [`quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish` GitHub
  Action][quarto-publish] so that the pages resolve to the custom domain.

## Definitions


## The Problem

If you use plain [GitHub Pages][ghpages] then you can set a custom `CNAME` by going to _Settings > Pages > Custom
Domain_ and entering the address there. However, as [documented][custom-cname] (see item 4) this doesn't work if you use
a custom GitHub Action to publish your website, which is the case when you use the [`quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish`
GitHub Action][quarto-publish] to publish using Quarto.

Why? Because each time the action runs it regenerates the content of the `gh-pages` branch on the runner and pushes it
to your repository and _doesn't_ include a custom `CNAME` file

## The Solution

The solution I hit upon was to add an extra step to my `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` that...

1. Checks out the `gh-pages` branch.
2. Creates the `CNAME` file with the domain I use.
3. Adds this to the `gh-pages` branch.
4. Pushes back up-stream.

You should already have added a [publish action][publish-action] to your repository which runs the
[`quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish` GitHub Action][quarto-publish]. This runs `quarto publish $TARGET` where `$TARGET`
is set by the chosen output configured in the `target` argument. In this example `gh-pages`

```yaml
      - name: Render and Publish
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

After this you should add the following, substituting `blog.nshephard.dev` for your own domain.

```yaml
      - name: Add CNAME file to gh-pages branch
        run: |
          rm renv/activate.R
          git switch gh-pages
          git pull
          echo 'blog.nshephard.dev > CNAME
          git add CNAME
          git commit -m "Adding CNAME"
          git push
```

This...

1. Removes the lingering `renv/activate.R` which prevents switching branches.
2. Switches branches to `gh-pages`.
3. `git pull` to get the just published version of the branch.
4. Creates the `CNAME` file with the domain you specify.
5. Adds (stages) the `CNAME` file to the `gh-pages` branch.
6. Commits the change.
7. Pushes the commit to `origin` (i.e. the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub)
