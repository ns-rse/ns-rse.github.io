I started running in 2019. It never appealed but I needed to get regular exercise easily from my doorstep as despite
commuting by bike for most of my life and cycling between 12-20km daily it wasn't enough and more recently I prefer
running over cycling because of the dire attitude of a fair proportion of motorists towards cyclists.

I also like data and record my runs (and cycles) using. A long time ago I used to use Endomondo but
didn't like the idea of sharing my personal location data with a random company so went private and now use the privacy
respecting  [OpenTracks]() (converting existing logs promted me to write the Python package [tcx2gpx]() to convert the
GPS traces to something OpenTracks would import).

I use [Emacs]() for most of my work, often using [Org-mode]() which offers literate programming via [Org-Babel]() and so
my logged runs/cycles/hikes/climbs are summarised in Org-mode and then converted to HTML and uploaded to my Virtual
Private Server (VPS) where I host my own website (using [Nginx]()) and I can see my progress at
[online](https://kimura.no-ip.info/~arch/training/training.html).

At some point early in 2022 I decided to set myself an arbitrary goal of running at least 1200km in the year. It seemed
a nice round number at 100km/month. This post summarises the data collected during that period and serves as a learning
exercise for me to refresh/improve my [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org) knowledge.

# Data

My data is captured using [~org-capture~]() in an ASCII text file, but its wrapped in an [org-mode table](). For the
purpose of this post I have saved this to a CSV so that it can be included in the page itself, but in order to do so I
wrote the following chunk which determines where to load the file from.

## Number of Runs

## Distance

## Pace

## When Do I Run?

I'm much more a morning person and typically go out running on an empty stomach as I find it quite unpleasant to have a
bellyful of food jiggling around inside me. But what days of the week and times do I actually go running? I can answer
this with only a low degree of accuracy because whilst I do try to log my runs immediately after having completed them
(post-stretching!) I don't always do so.
