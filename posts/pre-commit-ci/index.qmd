**NB** If you've not read it already I would recommend reading my previous post on using
[pre-commit](https://ns-rse.github.io/posts/pre-commit/) as the contents described herein assume that you are already
using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) in your development.

Having [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) setup locally to run before making commits is great. Typically code lives in
a "forge" such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and as `pre-commit` is run on each commit
you shouldn't have any problems when you come to `git push` your code to the remote `origin` repository (i.e. the
repository hosted on GitHub/GitLab) as all `pre-commit` checks will have to have passed before this will take place.

But what if for some reason you disabled `pre-commit` just to make some changes rather than addressing the failed
linting or test? Or if you work on an open-source project and someone else contributes how can you ensure that their
contributed code meets the code-style chosen by the project and that all tests pass in light of the changes that are
being introduced?

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

The solution to this is Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) which runs various hooks on GitHub/GitLab
etc. in response to specific tasks/actions that occur on the repository. The exact name or system used depends on the
forge, on GitHub these are [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) (see also [Actions
  Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)) whilst on GitLab uses
[Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/). There are even standalone systems which integrate with both
such as the popular [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io).

**By employing `pre-commit` as part of your CI/CD pipeline you ensure code meets the standards (linting, tests etc.) you
wish contributions to meet before it is merged into your `main`/`master` branch`**

These work by running processes under certain conditions, for example on a `push` to the `main` branch or a `tag` that
begins with `v`, and they might run processes such as running the test suite for your project to ensure all tests pass,
build web-pages or build the package for deployment to a repository (e.g. [PyPI](https://pypi.org)). They are really
useful and flexible systems and can be leveraged to run `pre-commit` on your code when Pull Requests (PR) are made to
ensure the PR passes the various hooks. Ultimately a PR results in a `commit` to `master`/`main` and so its logically
consistent that Pull Requests should pass `pre-commit` prior to being merged.

Under any system you could write your own hook to run `pre-commit` but there is an even easier and more efficient
solution if you use GitHub in the form of [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci).

## GitHub and pre-commit.ci

Currently [pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) only supports GitHub although support of other systems is in the
pipeline. `pre-commit.ci` doesn't need any configuration beyond your already existing  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (see
[Pre-commit : Protecting Your Future Self](https://ns-rse.github.io/posts/pre-commit/)). Where a `pre-commit` hook
corrects formatting issues as is the case with some of the defaults such as `trailing-whitespace` or `check-yaml`, or if
you are using Python linters such as [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or
[`ruff`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) which fix errors, `pre-commit.ci` can commit these changes and push them
back to the Pull Request automatically. In a similar vein it will also routinely update the `rev` used in your
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, commit the change and push it back to your repository.

It is also really fast because `pre-commit.ci` keeps the virtual environments that are used in tests cached whereas if
you wrote your own action to run this the GitHub runner that is spun up to run GitHub Actions would have to download all
of these each time the action is run is they are not persistent.

Use of `pre-commit.ci` is free for open-source repositories and there are paid options for private or organisation
repositories.

> **Benefits of pre-commit.ci**
>
> * Supports GitHub but more to come in the future.
> * Zero configuration, just need `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
> * Corrects & commits formatting issues automatically without need for developer to reformat.
> * Automatically updates `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for you (e.g. new `rev`).
> * Faster than your own GitHub Action.
> * Free for open source repositories (paid for version for private/organisation repositories).

### Configuration (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

Whilst not required it is possible to configure the behaviour of `pre-commit.ci` by adding a `ci:` section to your
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`. The fields are fairly self-explanatory as the example below shows. Its possible to toggle
whether to `autofix_prs` and to set the `autofix_commit_msg`. The `autoupdate_schedule` can be set to `weekly`,
`monthly` or `quarterly` along with a custom `autoupdate_commit_msg`. Finally you can optionally disable some hooks from
being run only in `pre-commit.ci`.

``` {.yaml}
ci:
  autofix_prs: true
  autofix_commit_msg: '[pre-commit.ci] Fixing issues with pre-commit'
  autoupdate_schedule: weekly
  autoupdate_commit_msg: '[pre-commit.ci] pre-commit automatically updated revs.'
  skip: [pylint] # Optionally list ids of hooks to skip on CI
```

### Setup

Setup is relatively straight-forward, head to [https://pre-commit.ci](https://pre-commit.ci) and sign-in with your
GitHub account and grant `pre-commit.ci` access to your account.

![Pre-commit CI](img/pre-commit-ci.png)

Once you have granted access you can choose which repositories `pre-commit.ci` has access to. It is possible to grant
access to all repositories but I would recommend doing so on a per-repository basis so you know and are in control of
what is happening across your repositories. If you have administration rights to organisation repositories these should
be listed in the "_Select repositories_" pull-down menu.

### `pre-commit.ci` jobs

When logged into `pre-commit.ci` using your GitHub account you are presented with a page similar to the following which
lists the accounts and any organisations that you have authorised `pre-commit.ci` to access.

![Pre-commit.ci account access](img/account-pre-commit-ci.png)

You can follow the links through to view the history of jobs run by `pre-commit.ci` and whether they pass or fail. The
page shows the current status and provides both Markdown and reStructured Text code for adding badges to your source
documents (e.g. the Markdown badge can be added to your repositories top-level `README.md` and the badge will be
displayed on GitHub)

![Pre-commit.ci jobs pass](img/pre-commit-ci-pass2.png)

You can click through and see the results of a given run and when they
[pass](https://results.pre-commit.ci/run/github/168173540/1674062271.Tj4xDOxqRFu3CDIPhXkMJA) they look similar to the
output you would have seen when making commits locally.

![Pre-commit.ci jobs pass](img/pre-commit-ci-pass3.png)

But sometimes things will [fail](https://results.pre-commit.ci/run/github/168173540/1674061180.-2Eo_dbfRAGrukip387Nhg)
as shown below where the `trailing-whitespace` hook failed and the file was modified. But since `pre-commit.ci` corrects
and pushes such changes automatically you can see at the bottom that these changes were pushed to the Pull Request from
which the originated.

## GitLab

As [`pre-commit.ci`](https://pre-commit.ci) doesn't (yet) support GitLab integrating `pre-commit` into your GitLab
Pipeline is a little more involved. What follows is based on the excellent post on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/articles/71270196/how-to-use-pre-commit-to-automatically-correct-commits-and-merge-requests-with-g)
describing how to achieve this integration.

You should already have a valid `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in place (if not work through [Pre-commit : Protecting your
future self  (blog-post)](https://ns-rse.github.io/posts/pre-commit/)). To enable `pre-commit` on your [GitLab
Pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/) you need to to have a pipeline in place. This is a file in the root
of your repository called `.gitlab-ci.yml`. You need to add the following to this file...

``` {.yaml}
variables:
  # since we're not using merge request pipelines in this example,
  # we will configure the pre-commit job to run on branch pipelines only.
  # If you ARE using merge request pipelines, you can omit this section
  PRE_COMMIT_DEDUPLICATE_MR_AND_BRANCH: false
  PRE_COMMIT_AUTO_FIX_BRANCH_ONLY: true

include:
  - remote: 'https://gitlab.com/yesolutions/gitlab-ci-templates/raw/main/templates/pre-commit-autofix.yaml'

```

This uses the `pre-commit-autofix.yaml` from [yesolutions](https://gitlab.com/yesolutions/) to run `pre-commit` and as
the configuration shows automatically apply fixes `pre-commit` makes to your code. There are more options available for
configuring this pipeline and they are documented [here](https://gitlab.com/yesolutions/gitlab-ci-templates).

Because you are allowing a third-party pipeline to access your repository when pushing the changes `pre-commit` makes
back to your repository for this to work you _must_ create a [project access
token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html). Under the repositories _Settings >
Access Tokens_ you can create a new token with an expiry date. You must then create a CI/CD variable called
`PRE_COMMIT_ACCESS_TOKEN` with this token as a value.

Once you have done this your CI/CD pipeline should show at the very start the `.pre` stage...

![GitLab pre-commit pipeline.](img/gitlab-pre-commit-pipeline.png)

...and you can click through on this to see the details of the pipeline. Note that it takes a while to run as it has to
download and initialise all of the environments for each configured hook unlike [`pre-commit.ci`](https://pre-commit.ci)
(this is akin to writing your own [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to run `pre-commit` which would
also have to download and initialise the environments).

## Summary

This article has covered

* Why to integrate [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) into your Continuous
Integration/Delivery pipeline.
* What the [`pre-commit.ci`](https://pre-commit.ci) service is and the benefits it provides.
* How to integrate [`pre-commit.ci`](https://pre-commit.ci) with [GitHub](https://github.com) repositories.
* How to integrate [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) with [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) repositories.

By automating linting and testing in this manner you improve and shorten the feedback loop for developers and
contributors which frees up more time and focus on the code itself.
