Most people use web-browsers a fair bit. There are a number of extensions available which make their use more
stream-lined and efficient. This post covers those that I use. If there is something that you use regularly and find
useful I'd love to hear about it (see links at top of page).

## Browser Choice

I deliberately eschew Chrome and even its open-source relative [Chromium](https://chromium.org/) because of the tracking
built into the system. Instead I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.com/firefox) as my main browser and for work I use
[Opera](https://www.opera.com/). I've also dabbled with [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) which I quite like and should
use more.

Most of the plugins discussed here work across browsers, although for Opera and Vivaldi it is often the case of
installing the Chrome extensions which work because of the development/toolkit on which the browser is based.

## Plugins/Extensions

Plugins/extensions add additional functionality to your browser. I use many for blocking adverts and trackers and I list
those below and find they make browsing cleaner and faster (I also block many such sites via my router but that is a
separate post). But protecting your privacy is not the only purpose of extensions, many can streamline your browser
usage and workflow and that is the main focus of this article.

Firefox Extensions are available at [Firefox Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/extensions/), as
mentioned those for Opera and Vivaldi are typically installed via the [Chrome Web
Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).

### [BibItNow](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bibitnow/)

This is invaluable if you undertake any academic work and use citations. Once installed it adds a short-cut for
generating [BibTex](http://www.bibtex.org/) and other citation formats from the page being visited. This can then be
copy and pasted into your database with a few keystrokes.

It is possible to customise the fields that are included e.g. by default _Abtract_ is not included, but its something I
like to include in my citation database for a quick overview of what a paper is about.

### [Copy URL to Clipboard](https://github.com/asamuzaK/url2clipboard)

Links are the blood of the internet and when reading and taking notes I like to link to the source I am using. This
plugin makes it a doddle and will create a link to the page that is being viewed (or highlighted text) to a range of
formats including [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org),
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/),
[reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html).

Binding each link type to specific keys means its incredibly easy to copy and paste links from browser to
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (where I do most of my writing).

### [Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension)

Many papers are, unfairly given the research that paid for them is often from the public purse, behind
PayWalls. Thankfully with the rise of pre-print servers such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/),
[biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [F1000](https://f1000research.com/) and the forthcoming
[Octopus](https://octopus.ac) pre-prints and alternatives to pay-walled articles are available and
[Unpaywall](https://unpaywall.org/products/extension) is a plugin that automatically finds them for you. Install it and
when you visit an articles page if its behind a paywall but available freely elsewhere a green-symbol with an unlocked
padlock appears on the right-hand side of your browser. If its not available this is a locked padlock on a grey
background.

### [BrowserPass](https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-extension)

Everyone should use a Password Manager of some description, I use [Pass: The Standard Unix Password
Manager](https://www.passwordstore.org/) and to get it to work seamlessly with my browsers I use
[BrowserPass](https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-extension). It requires a little configuration so read the
GitHub page carefully but once working it is seamless. I visit a web-site and because I organise my passwords to include
the URL all I need to do is use `Ctrl-Shift-f` and if my GPG key is unlocked the password is entered for me. My GPG key
is unlocked using my
[Yubikey](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013790259-Using-Your-YubiKey-with-OpenPGP) so if this isn't
plugged in and unlocked I'm prompted to do so. Makes logging in to web-sites so much faster.

### [org-capture](https://github.com/sprig/org-capture-extension)

Probably only useful if you use the amazing "Capture" web-site, title and selected text to Emacs in Org-mode via
[org-protocol](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html).

### [GitLab Notify](https://github.com/Mikescops/gitlab-notify-extension)

Get notifications from GitLab in your browser.

### [Octotree](https://www.octotree.io/)

Not used this much as I only discovered it recently whilst working on this article but it improves navigation of GitHub
repositories. The main, free, feature that is of most use is a sidebar to aid navigation of a repositories code. This
can be pinned if required.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Binding actions you take with extensions to keyboard short-cuts can save a considerable amount of time, particularly if
you are a heavy typist, as it saves the small amount of time taken to move the hand to the mouse, locate the pointer and
move it to where it needs to be.

Not every extension has shortcuts associated with it, but for those that do in Firefox you can configure this by going
to [Add-ons and themes](about:addons) and at the top-right of the page listing the installed extensions, adjacent to
_Manage Your Extensions_ is a cog. Left-click on this once and a menu appears and at the bottom you can select _Manage
Extension Shortcuts_. This allows you to bind "key-chords" (combinations of keys) to each plugins action. If there are
conflicts (i.e. the same key-binding is bound to two actions) then these are highlighted and can be corrected.

## Summary

These are but a few of the vast array of productivity extensions you can make use of. Which you find useful and would
use will be dependent on your browser usage and work

### Privacy Protecting Extensions

I've not gone into detail about the privacy protecting extensions I use but have listed them below. There is
overlap/redundancy in what I'm using but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I do find it breaks some sites
(e.g. Amazon) but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as it encourages me to shop more ethically and I can always switch
browsers if needs be.
