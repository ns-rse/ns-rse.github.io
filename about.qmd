Hi, I'm Neil and work as a [Research Software Engineer](https://rse.shef.ac.uk) at the University of Sheffield. My
education started with BSc in Zoology and Genetics followed by a MSc in Genetic Epidemiology. I spent time as a Genetics
Statistician before shifting to Medical Statistics and working on Clinical Trials where I learnt GNU/Linux system
administration and R before a stint as a Data Scientist at a telematics company where I not only learnt Python but about
good software development practices.

Here you'll find Research Software Engineering, Git/GitHub/GitLab, GNU/Linux (Gentoo, Arch, OpenWRT), Python, Bash, R,
Emacs, Org-mode, Statistics, Genetics, Evolution and more.

When not working I enjoy climbing, running, cycling, cooking, hiking, photography, gardening and spending time with my family.
