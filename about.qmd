Hi, I'm Neil and work as a [Research Software Engineer](https://rse.shef.ac.uk) at the University of Sheffield. My
education started with BSc in Zoology and Genetics followed by a MSc in Genetic Epidemiology. My academic career started
with just over a decade as a Genetics Statistician where I learnt GNU/Linux system administration and reproducible
research practices before shifting to Medical Statistics and working on Clinical Trials for a similar amount of time and
taught myself R before a stint as a Data Scientist in industry company where I not only learnt Python but about good
software development practices.

Here you'll find posts about Research Software Engineering, Git/GitHub/GitLab, GNU/Linux (Gentoo, Arch, OpenWRT),
Python, Bash, R, Emacs, Org-mode, Statistics, Genetics, Evolution and more.

When not working I enjoy climbing, running, cycling, cooking, hiking, photography, gardening and spending time with my
family.
