I spent time as a Genetics Statistician before shifting to Medical Statistics and working on Clinical Trials where I learnt GNU/Linux system administration and R before a stint as a Data Scientist at a telematics company where I not only learnt Python but about good software development practices.\nHere you’ll find Research Software Engineering, Git/GitHub/GitLab, GNU/Linux (Gentoo, Arch, OpenWRT), Python, Bash, R, Statistics, Genetics, Evolution and more.\nWhen not working I enjoy climbing, running, cycling, cooking, hiking, photography, gardening and spending time with my family."
