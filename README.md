This is the repository for the site [ns-rse.github.io](https://ns-rse.github.io) which is written in
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) by [Neil Shephard](https://github.com/ns-rse).

Many articles are written here before being published on my employers blog [RSE University of
Sheffield](https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog) or they are updated versions of posts there.
